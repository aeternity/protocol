# Serialization formats

The serialization formats in this document describes the binary format
used to encode the different objects in the binary format that is used
for:

* Hashing (e.g., block hash)
* Insertion in the Merkle Patricia Tree (e.g., state trees, transaction trees).
* Signing transactions (i.e., the serialized form is signed).

Other formats may be used for communication between nodes or for the
user API.

## Blocks and headers

There are two types of blocks:

* micro block - contains a header and a list of transactions.
* key block - contains only a header.

Blocks are serialized in a staged manner for uniformity. The key block
does not contain any more information than the header, so the
representation of the block and the header is the same. Micro blocks
has a static size header and a dynamic size "body".

The header starts with a version number (32 bits), followed by a
reserved flags field (32 bits). The first flag bit marks the header as
a key or micro header. Other flag fields are defined separately for
the header types. Note that unused flags must be set to zero.

| Header type flag | Header type |
| ---              | ---         |
| 0                | micro       |
| 1                | key         |

### Key block/header

All field sizes are statically known and can be constructed directly
as a byte array. The header starts with a version number (32 bits),
followed by a reserved flags field (32 bits).

For flag bits:
* In Roma release, only one flag bit is used, to mark the header as a key header.
* In Minerva release, another bit is used, to mark the presence of an optional info field in the header.
* Other flags must be set to zero.

| Fieldname  | Size (bytes) | Notes |
| --- | ---  | --- |
| version     | 32 bits | |
| key_tag     | 1 bit   | |
| info_flag   | 1 bit            | From Minerva protocol |
| unused_flag | 1 bit (set to 0) | For Roma protocol |
| unused_flags| 30 bits (all set to 0) | |
| height      | 8    | |
| prev_hash   | 32   | |
| prev_key_hash | 32   | |
| state_hash  | 32   | |
| miner       | 32   | |
| beneficiary | 32   | |
| target      | 4    | |
| pow         | 168  | |
| nonce       | 8    | |
| time        | 8    | |
| info        | 0 or 4 | From Minerva protocol |

Note:

* The info field is either present, and of size 4 bytes, or not
  present (0 bytes). The presence of the info field must be signalled
  by setting the info_flag to 1. The contents of the info field has no
  current interpretation, but the plan is to use it to signal
  information about the miners (e.g., if the miners are aware of a
  coming hard fork).

### Micro block

| Fieldname    | Size |
| ---          | ---  |
| Micro Header | 216 or 238 bytes (see below) |
| [Micro Body](#micro-body)| variable |

### Micro block header

| Fieldname | Size (bytes) |
| --- | --- |
| version    | 32 bits |
| micro_tag  | 1 bit   |
| has_fraud  | 1 bit   |
| unused_flags| 30 bits (all set to 0) |
| height     | 8    |
| prev_hash  | 32   |
| prev_key_hash | 32   |
| state_hash | 32   |
| txs_hash   | 32   |
| time       | 8    |
| fraud_hash | 0 or 32 |
| signature  | 64   |

Note:

* The field for *signature* (64 bytes) must be filled
  with only zeroes when constructing or validating the signature.

* The micro block header has two valid sizes depending on whether the
  block contains Proof of Fraud or not. This is signalled using the
  *has_fraud* flag.

| has_fraud | fraud_hash size |
| ---       | ---             |
| 1         | 32 bytes        |
| 0         | 0  bytes        |



## Dynamic size object serialization

In this section we use `[]` to mean lists, `<name>` to denote fields,
`,` to separate fields in lists. We use `::` to separate fields from
their types . We use `int()` to denote the integer type and `binary()`
to denote the byte array type. Variable length lists are denoted with
`[]` in the type domain (e.g., `[int()]` is a list of integers).
Fixed length lists are denoted with '{}' (e.g. '{int(), int()}')
denotes a list of exactly two integers. We use `++` as the list
concatenation operator. We also use the `bool()` type as the special
case of the integers `0` and `1` used as the boolean type.

### The id() type

The special type `id()` is a `binary()` denoting a tagged binary
(e.g., hash or public key) referring to an object in the chain (e.g.,
account, oracle) . The first byte is a tag denoting which type of
identifier, and the remaining 32 bytes is the identifier itself. This
is used to distinguish between identifiers where there can be
ambiguity.

| Id tag | Identifier type |
| ---    | ---             |
| 1      | account         |
| 2      | name            |
| 3      | commitment      |
| 4      | oracle          |
| 5      | contract        |
| 6      | channel         |

In Erlang notation, the `id()` type pattern is:
```
<<Tag:1/unsigned-integer-unit:8, Hash:32/binary-unit:8>>
```

### The call_return_type() type

The special type `call_return_type()` is an `int()` denoting the outcome of a contract call.

| Value | Return type |
| ---   | ---         |
| 0     | ok          |
| 1     | error       |
| 2     | revert      |

### RLP Encoding

We use the Recursive Length Prefix encoding
(https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/RLP) for serializing objects that
have dynamic sizes of the fields.

RLP ensures that there is only one serialization of each corresponding
object on the lowest level, but it can only encode two primitive
objects, lists and byte arrays.

RLP ensures that the serialization is a non-empty byte array.

Objects in Ã†ternity are encoded as lists of fields, where the two
first fields describe the object type and the object version.

```
[ <tag>, <version>, <field1>, <field2>...]
```

Since all values are byte arrays in RLP, `int()` needs to be a byte
array as well. We encode all integers as unsigned, big endian byte
arrays. To avoid ambiguity in the encoding of integers, we adapt the
same scheme as RLP and demand that integers are encoded with the
minimal number of bytes (i.e., disallow leading zeroes in the encoded
byte array). Negative integers is not used in the serialization format
since they are not needed. If the need arises, the scheme should be
extended.


### Binary serialization

The serialization, `S`, of a dynamic size object, `O`, is defined as

```
S(O) = rlp([tag(O), vsn(O)] ++ fields(O))
```

where the tag is given in the table below, and the fields are in the
subsequent sections divided by object.

]
```

#### Contract

For a contract with address `<contractpubkey>`, the fields of the contract object (to which tag and version need to be prepended) are:

```
[ <owner>      :: id()
, <ct_version> :: int()
, <code>       :: binary()
, <log>        :: binary(),
, <active>     :: bool(),
, <referers>   :: [id()],
, <deposit>    :: int()
]
```

The log field is always the empty binary.

The balance of the account is stored in the account state tree.

The contract storage (or state) which is a key value map from (key::binary() to value::binary())
is stored in its own subtree. The key for a contract storage value is:
```
<contractpubkey><16><key> :: binary()
```
The `<key>` is non-empty.

Each value is just stored as a binary as is - without tag or version.
If the value is the empty binary the key is pruned from the tree.

The content of the contract store depends on [the ABI and the VM version](/contracts/contract_vms.md).

, <ttl>       :: int()
]
```

The recipient must be one of the following:
* An account identifier.
* A name identifier, whose related name entry has an identifier as value of pointer with key `account_pubkey`.
  If multiple pointer entries are present for such key, then the first of such entries is used.

, <fee>             :: int()
, <nonce>           :: int()
]
```

The payload is a serialized co-signed channel off-chain transaction or it is empty.
The round is the new channel's round that will be produced by the forcing of
progress.
The update is the contract call update to be applied on the old channel's
state.
The state hash is the expected root hash of the produced channel's state trees
after the update had been applied to the channel state provided in the proof
of inclusion.
The proof of inclusion has the same root hash as the state hash of the co-signed
payload.

#### Channel off-chain update

Channel update rounds are described by various updates, that are defined in
this subsection. Each mention of type update() in the rest of this document is
meant to be understood as referring to any one of these updates. If not specified
something different, any of the addresses involved could belong to a participant,
contract or even some other address part of the off-chain state tree of this channel.

###### Channel off-chain update transfer

This is an internal off-chain transfer from one address to another.

```
[ <from>    			:: id()
, <to>      			:: id()
, <amount>  			:: int()
]

```

###### Channel off-chain update deposit

This is an internal off-chain balance increment. It is used by the
`channel_deposit_tx` internal representation.

```
[ <from>    			:: id()
, <amount>  			:: int()
]

```

###### Channel off-chain update withdrawal

This is an internal off-chain balance decrement. It is used by the
`channel_withdraw_tx` internal representation.

```
[ <to>      			:: id()
, <amount>  			:: int()
]

```

###### Channel off-chain update create contract

This is an update for creating new contracts inside channel's off-chain state
tree.

```
[ <owner>      :: id()
, <ct_version> :: int()
, <code>       :: binary()
, <deposit>    :: int()
, <call_data>  :: binary()
]

```

###### Channel off-chain update call contract

This is an update for calling a contract inside channel's off-chain state
tree.

[ <caller>      :: id()
, <contract>    :: id(),
, <abi_version> :: int()
, <amount>      :: int()
, <call_data>   :: binary()

#### Proof of inclusion on state trees (POI) :: poi()
```
[ {<accounts>  :: [<proof_of_inclusion> :: {<root_hash> :: binary(), [{<mpt_hash> :: binary(), <mpt_value> :: [binary()]}]}]}
, {<calls>     :: [<proof_of_inclusion> :: {<root_hash> :: binary(), [{<mpt_hash> :: binary(), <mpt_value> :: [binary()]}]}]}
, {<channels>  :: [<proof_of_inclusion> :: {<root_hash> :: binary(), [{<mpt_hash> :: binary(), <mpt_value> :: [binary()]}]}]}
, {<contracts> :: [<proof_of_inclusion> :: {<root_hash> :: binary(), [{<mpt_hash> :: binary(), <mpt_value> :: [binary()]}]}]}
, {<ns>        :: [<proof_of_inclusion> :: {<root_hash> :: binary(), [{<mpt_hash> :: binary(), <mpt_value> :: [binary()]}]}]}
, {<oracles>   :: [<proof_of_inclusion> :: {<root_hash> :: binary(), [{<mpt_hash> :: binary(), <mpt_value> :: [binary()]}]}]}
]
```

If a subtree (e.g. `<accounts>`) is empty, then its serialization is just `[]` (e.g. `<accounts>` is `[]`) otherwise it contains at least its root hash (e.g. `<accounts>` is `[{<root_hash>, []}]`).

NOTE: `[{<mpt_hash>, <mpt_value>}]` is the sorted list of Merkle Patricia Tree nodes in the proof.

NOTE: As the POI contains the Merkle Patricia Tree nodes (e.g. not only their hashes):
* Each state subtree does not necessarily contain elements of the same key length.
* The object itself does not contain its own id as it can be derived from the location in the tree.
* The key used for storing each object in each state subtree is not necessarily derived from the object itself.
* The value(s) whose inclusion the POI proves is included in the POI itself.

#### Merkle Patricia Value
```
[ <key>        :: binary()
, <val>        :: binary()
]
```
#### Merkle Patricia Tree :: mtree()
```
[ <values>        :: [binary()]
]
```

All Merkle Patricia Values are serialized.

#### State trees :: trees()
```
[ <contracts>   ::  binary()
, <calls>       ::  binary()
, <channels>    ::  binary()
, <ns>          ::  binary()
, <oracles>     ::  binary()
, <accounts>    ::  binary()
]
```

All binaries are serialized as follows:

##### Contracts' state tree
```
[ <contracts>    :: binary()
]
```

The binary is a serialized Merkle Patricia Tree.

##### Contract Calls' state tree
```
[ <calls>        ::  binary()
]
```

The binary is a serialized Merkle Patricia Tree.

##### Channels' state tree
```
[ <channels>     :: binary()
]
```

The binary is a serialized Merkle Patricia Tree.

##### Nameservice's state tree
```
[ <mtree>       :: binary()
]
```

The binary is a serialized Merkle Patricia Tree.

##### Oracles' state tree
```
[ <otree>       :: binary()
]
```

The binary is a serialized Merkle Patricia Tree.

##### Accounts' state tree
```
[ <accounts>      :: binary()
]
```

The binary is a serialized Merkle Patricia Tree.

#### Sophia byte code (version 1, Roma release)
```
[ <source code hash> :: binary()
, <type info>        :: [{<fun_hash> :: binary(), <fun_name> :: binary(), <arg_type> :: binary(), <out_type> :: binary()}]
, <byte code>        :: binary()
]
```

#### Sophia byte code (version 2, Minerva release)
```
[ <source code hash> :: binary()
, <type info>        :: [{<fun_hash> :: binary(), <fun_name> :: binary(), <arg_type> :: binary(), <out_type> :: binary()}]
, <byte code>        :: binary()
, <compiler version> :: binary()
]
```

### Generalized accounts
Generalized accounts are available from version 3, Fortuna release. A
generalized account is interchangeable with a basic (non-generalized) account
everywhere, the only difference is that it is not able to directly sign a
transaction. Instead the transaction has to be wrapped in a [meta
transaction](#generalized-accounts-meta-transaction) with the correct
authorization data.

#### Generalized accounts attach transaction
```
[ <owner_id>   :: id()
, <nonce>      :: int()
, <code>       :: binary()
, <auth_fun>   :: binary()
, <ct_version> :: int()
, <fee>        :: int()
, <ttl>        :: int()
, <gas>        :: int()
, <gas_price>  :: int()
, <call_data>  :: binary()
]
```

#### Generalized accounts meta transaction
```
[ <ga_id>       :: id()
, <auth_data>   :: binary()
, <abi_version> :: int()
, <fee>         :: int()
, <gas>         :: int()
, <gas_price>   :: int()
, <ttl>         :: int()
, <tx>          :: binary()
]
```


#### Micro Body
```
[ <transactions>    :: [binary()]
, <proof_of_fraud>> :: [binary()]
]
```
NOTE:
* The *transactions* are signed transactions.
* The *proof_of_fraud* list is either empty (i.e., no fraud) or has one element (i.e., contains one proof of fraud).


#### Proof of fraud
```
[ <header1>  :: binary()
, <header2>  :: binary()
, <pubkey>   :: binary()
]
```
