# Serialization formats

The serialization formats in this document describes the binary format
used to encode the different objects in the binary format that is used
for:

* Hashing (e.g., block hash)
* Insertion in the Merkle Patricia Tree (e.g., state trees, transaction trees).
* Signing transactions (i.e., the serialized form is signed).

Other formats may be used for communication between nodes or for the
user API.



## Static size object serialization

There are two types of blocks:

* key block - does not contain a list of transactions, therefore, it is
not divided into a header and a list of transactions;
* micro block - contains a header, a list of transactions and a signature.

### Key block

All field sizes are statically known and can be constructed directly as
a byte array.

| Fieldname  | Size (bytes) |
| --- | ---  |
| version     | 8    |
| height      | 8    |
| prev_hash   | 32   |
| state_hash  | 32   |
| miner       | 32   |
| beneficiary | 32   |
| target      | 8    |
| pow         | 168  |
| nonce       | 8    |
| time        | 8    |

### Micro block header

All field sizes of a micro block header are statically known and can be
constructed directly as a byte array.

| Fieldname | Size (bytes) |
| --- | --- |
| version    | 8    |
| height     | 8    |
| prev_hash  | 32   |
| state_hash | 32   |
| txs_hash   | 32   |
| key_hash   | 32   |
| time       | 8    |

### Micro block

The only difference between a micro block and its header is a list of
transactions and a signature. The transactions are captured in the
header by the transaction root hash (`txs_hash`). The block does not
currently have a separate binary serialization form since the block
hash is computed from the block header.

## Dynamic size object serialization

In this section we use `[]` to mean lists, `<name>` to denote fields,
`,` to separate fields in lists. We use `::` to separate fields from
their types . We use `int()` to denote the integer type and `binary()`
to denote the byte array type. Lists are denoted with `[]` in the type
domain (e.g., `[int()]` is a list of integers). We use `++` as the
list concatenation operator. We also use the `bool()` type as the
special case of the integers `0` and `1` used as the boolean type.

### The id() type

The special type `id()` is a `binary()` denoting a tagged binary
(e.g., hash or public key) referring to an object in the chain (e.g.,
account, oracle) . The first byte is a tag denoting which type of
identifier, and the remaining 32 bytes is the identifier itself. This
is used to distinguish between identifiers where there can be
ambiguity.

| Id tag | Identifier type |
| ---    | ---             |
| 1      | account         |
| 2      | name            |
| 3      | commitment      |
| 4      | oracle          |
| 5      | contract        |
| 6      | channel         |

In Erlang notation, the `id()` type pattern is:
```
<<Tag:1/unsigned-integer-unit:8, Hash:32/binary-unit:8>>
```


### RLP Encoding

We use the Recursive Length Prefix encodng
(https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/RLP) for serializing objects that
have dynamic sizes of the fields.

RLP ensures that there is only one serialization of each corresponding
object on the lowest level, but it can only encode two primitive
objects, lists and byte arrays.

RLP ensures that the serialization is a non-empty byte array.

Objects in Ã†ternity are encoded as lists of fields, where the two
first fields describe the object type and the object version.

```
[ <tag>, <version>, <field1>, <field2>...]
```

Since all values are byte arrays in RLP, `int()` needs to be a byte
array as well. We encode all integers as unsigned, big endian byte
arrays. To avoid ambiguity in the encoding of integers, we adapt the
same scheme as RLP and demand that integers are encoded with the
minimal number of bytes (i.e., disallow leading zeroes in the encoded
byte array). Negative integers is not used in the serialization format
since they are not needed. If the need arises, the scheme should be
extended.


### Binary serialization

The serialization, `S`, of a dynamic size object, `O`, is defined as

```
S(O) = rlp([tag(O), vsn(O)] ++ fields(O))
```

where the tag is given in the table below, and the fields are in the
subsequent sections divided by object.

]
```

#### Contract

For a contract with address `<contractpubkey>`, the fields of the contract object (to which tag and version need to be prepended) are:

```
[ <owner>      :: id()
, <vm_version> :: int()
, <code>       :: binary()
, <log>        :: binary(),
, <active>     :: bool(),
, <referers>   :: [id()],
, <deposit>    :: int()
]
```

The balance of the account is stored in the account state tree.

The contract storage (or state) which is a key value map from (key::binary() to value::binary())
is stored in its own subtree. The key for a contract storage value is:
```
<contractpubkey><16><key> :: binary()
```
The `<key>` is non-empty.

Each value is just stored as a binary as is - without tag or version.
If the value is the empty binary the key is pruned from the tree.

Contracts with vm_version == 1, i.e. Sophia contracts on the AEVM stores the memory layout of the
state as one binary value at address 0.

Contracts with vm_version == 2, i.e. Solidity contracts on the AEVM
stores the VM storage map containg 256 bit binaries for both keys and
values in the MPT. Undefined keys are treated as having the value 0
and keys bound to the value zero are stored as the empty binary, thus
purging them from the tree.

]
```

The payload is a serialized signed channel offchain transaction and can not be empty.

#### Channel offchain transaction

The channel offchain transaction is not included directly in the transaction tree but indirectly as payload of:
* The channel close solo transaction;
* The channel slash transaction.

```
[ <channel_id>       :: id()
, <round>            :: int()
, <updates>          :: [{int(), binary(), binary(), int()}]
, <state_hash>       :: binary()
]
```

#### Channel
```
[ <initiator>        :: id()
, <responder>        :: id()
, <total_amount>     :: int()
, <initiator_amount> :: int()
, <channel_reserve>  :: int()
, <state_hash>       :: binary()
, <round>            :: int()
, <lock_period>      :: int()
, <closes_at>        :: int()
]
```

#### Proof of inclusion on state trees (POI) :: poi()
```
[ {<accounts>  :: [<proof_of_inclusion> :: {<root_hash> :: binary(), [{<mpt_hash> :: binary(), [<mpt_value> :: binary()]}]}]}
, {<calls>     :: [<proof_of_inclusion> :: {<root_hash> :: binary(), [{<mpt_hash> :: binary(), [<mpt_value> :: binary()]}]}]}
, {<channels>  :: [<proof_of_inclusion> :: {<root_hash> :: binary(), [{<mpt_hash> :: binary(), [<mpt_value> :: binary()]}]}]}
, {<contracts> :: [<proof_of_inclusion> :: {<root_hash> :: binary(), [{<mpt_hash> :: binary(), [<mpt_value> :: binary()]}]}]}
, {<ns>        :: [<proof_of_inclusion> :: {<root_hash> :: binary(), [{<mpt_hash> :: binary(), [<mpt_value> :: binary()]}]}]}
, {<oracles>   :: [<proof_of_inclusion> :: {<root_hash> :: binary(), [{<mpt_hash> :: binary(), [<mpt_value> :: binary()]}]}]}
]
```

NOTE: `[{<mpt_hash>, <mpt_value>}]` is the sorted list of Merkle Patricia Tree nodes in the proof.
If the subtree (e.g. `<accounts>`) is empty,
then the serialization is just `[]` (e.g. `<accounts>` is `[{<root_hash>, []}]`);
otherwise it is a list of one element `[<proof_of_inclusion>]`
(e.g. `<accounts>` is `[{<root_hash>, [{<mpt_hash>, <mpt_value>}, {<mpt_hash>, <mpt_value>}]}]`;
`<accounts>` is `[{<root_hash>, []}]`).

NOTE: As the POI contains the Merkle Patricia Tree nodes (e.g. not only their hashes):
* Each state subtree does not necessarily contain elements of the same key length.
* The object itself does not contain its own id as it can be derived from the location in the tree.
* The key used for storing each object in each state subtree is not necessarily derived from the object itself.
* The value(s) whose inclusion the POI proves is included in the POI itself.
