# Gossip

As explained in the [Sync](SYNC.md) document, any blockchain implementation
needs communication with peers in order to be truly useful. Apart from the lower
level details described in that document, there is the added dimension of
how peers are selected for communication, how connections to those peers are
maintained over time. This is the purpose of gossiping functionality.

## Initial Configuration

The initial set of peers is defined by configuration when starting the node.
This is a predefined set of peers that are automatically connected to upon
startup.

## Peers

A peer is identified by a URI consisting of the protocol 'aenode://', the public
key, an '@' character, the hostname or IP number, a ':' character and the Noise
port number the node is using. If the address contains a hostname, it will be
resolved to an IP. Example:

```
aenode://pp$HryRGHJ7Ct3trkktVyVBgfhHL1J4EYSD9cScuMZDV61eSHrCZ@mynode.example.com:3015
```

A node is uniquely identified by its public key, and it can only have one IP and
port at the same time. This means one IP can have several instances of Epoch
started at the same time listening on different ports if they have different
public keys. This key corresponds to the private key that is used for the Noise
protocol listener associated with the IP and port.

Apart from being used in encryption via the Noise protocol, the public key is
also used to determine which node should keep its initiated connection open in
case two connections are opened (see
[Gossiping of New Peers](#gossiping-of-new-peers)).

### Gossiping of New Peers

Whenever a ping message is exchanged between peers, either a ping request or
ping response, the peers also attach a subset of neighboring peers they know of.
The node that generates the message populates the neighbor list with 30 peers
that are randomly selected from its pools (see
[Peers Maintenance](#peers-maintenance)).

When a ping request is received from another peer, that peer is first checked
for acceptance. This includes verifying

1. It is not the local node itself
2. The peer is not on the blocked list
3. It doesn't already have an existing connection

(3) refers to the case where two peers have learned about each other separately
and are both trying to initiate a connection. The connections are both initiated
via Noise, but once they are connected each node checks if they already have a
connection to that same peer. If they do, they will keep it if their public key
is larger than their peers, and drop it if not. This ordering of keys is
arbitrary but achieves the effect of only ever being true at one node or the
other. Thus, only one connection is kept.

Once the peer is accepted, all the neighbors not already verified are added to
the unverified pool. If this is the first ping from an inbound connection from
an unverified peer, the peer itself is added to the unverified pool too
(see [Peers Maintenance](#peers-maintenance) for more details).

### Peers Maintenance

The objectives of peer maintenance are:

1. Prevent peer poisoning (Sybil/eclipse attack)
2. Limit the number of active peer connections
3. Cache the known peers between restart to make peer poisoning harder.

To prevent an attacker from poisoning the list of peers, isolating the
node from the rest of the network, we make it impossible to predict
the set of peer's IP/port the attacker should control to fill enough of the list
for the attack to be statistically successful. In addition, we randomize the
peer eviction to prevent an attacker from predicting it and replace all good
peers for their own compromised ones.

This is achieved by first categorizing peers in two groups:

1. The unverified pool contains all the peers received through gossip.
It ensures no Byzantine node can fill it completely by limiting the subset
of the pool it can affect; it prevents attackers from predicting the set of
IP/port they must use to successfully eclipse the node.

2. The verified pool contains the peers the node connected to explicitly after
passing through the filter of the unverified pool. It randomizes the peer
distribution to the eye of attackers, preventing them from predicting the
eviction algorithm.

Peers are considered verified when the node has been able to connect to
them using the Noise protocol.

Both groups clusterize peers into multiple buckets; they select which one
an added peer belongs to based on a combination of the address of the node the
information is coming from, the address of the peer to be added and a secret
generated by the node for the purpose of randomizing the selection process.
See [Unverified Pool](#unverified-pool) and [Verified Pool](#verified-pool) for
more details on how the peers are added to the pools.

The peers received from configuration are added directly to the verified pool
and are marked as "trusted", meaning that they will never get downgraded to the
unverified pool even if the node cannot connect to them.

### Peer Groups

Peers are grouped by the 16 most significant bits of a peer IP (\16 mask).
This group is used when selecting a bucket and establishing the node outbound
connections to prevent nodes from being connected only to local nodes; this
make block forwarding more effective. NOTE: If all the nodes are in the same
group, they may not reach their maximum number of outbound connection and this
should probably be disabled.

### Connections

There are two pools of connections, inbound connection and outbound connections.

Both inbound and outbound connections are used for mempool, gossip and sync
protocol; but only outbound connections are used for relaying new blocks to
reduce the network load.

There is a hard limit on the maximum number of outbound connection
(default to 10).

There is a soft limit on the maximum of inbound connections (default to 100).
When it is reached, the node will still accept inbound connections, but they will
be closed right after responding to the first ping. This is a soft limit to allow
nodes to join the cluster even if the trusted nodes inbound limit has been
reached. In addition, this prevent a node, in particular a trusted node, to
have so much inbound connections that it cannot reach its number of outbound
connections; a guaranteed number of outbound connection is crucial for proper
propagation of new blocks. For all nodes to reach their established number of
outbound connections, the soft maximum limit for inbound connections must be
smaller than the maximum number of nodes minus the wanted number of outgoing
connections.

The node will first burst-connect to the trusted peers and then periodically
connects to more peers until it reaches the maximum number of outbound
connections; the delay between connections to new peers should be small enough
so the nodes has enough outbound connections to work properly, but large enough
so it has enough peers to choose from. This is done by having a variable delay
between connections of `2^(OUTBOUND_CONNECTION_COUNT - 1)` seconds when
`OUTBOUND_CONNECTION_COUNT` is greater than `0` with a maximum of `30` seconds;
this allow the node to reach 5 outbound connection under `15` seconds and
connect to the last peer when having received around `20` gossip messages.

The node iteratively picks a random peer (not yet connected) from either
the verified pool or the unverified pool (`0.5` probability by default),
that is from a different group ([See Peer Groups](#peer-groups)) than
any actual outbound connection. In case there are no more peers available in the
selected pool the other one will be tried. If the connection succeeds, an
unverified peer is upgraded to the verified pool and removed from the unverified
pool. If the connection fails, the peer retry counter and last retry time are
updated.

The node will periodically check a random peer from the pool without sending
a ping message, only establishing the Noise connection. This ensure the pool
contains enough reachable peers to reduce the chance of a Sybil attack were
most of the good peers are unreachable augmenting the probability of only
hostile node getting selected. (Not yet implemented).

If a peer changes its IP address but not its key, the new address will **never**
be updated through gossip. This is to prevent an hostil node from gossiping
bad addresses for known good nodes and making them unreachable. The peer will be
removed after the normal retry policy is exausted; then the new address will be
added through the usual gossip exchanges.

The peer retry counter and last retry time (initialized to '0' and 'infinity'),
are used to filter out peers when picking them from the pools providing
exponential backoff. After N failed attempts, a verified peer that is not
marked as trusted is downgraded to the unverified pool and the counter and time
is reset; unverified peers are simply removed.

Connected peers will periodically be pinged, and their connection state
monitored. The ping interval is configurable and defaults to once every 120
seconds. If a ping fails, this is logged and the peer is scheduled for another
ping in the normal interval.

#### Connection Cleanup

Connections are monitored and cleaned when inactive to prevent an attacker
from isolating the node by blocking chain traffic. If there is actually no
traffic, it will just accelerate the connection rotation.

- All connections without any chain-related activity (not counting gossip) for
more than 180 seconds will get disconnected. (Not yet implemented)
- All inbound connections that don't send a ping after 30 seconds will be
disconnected.
- All recent inbound connections (less than 90 seconds old) without any
chain-related activity (not counting gossip) will be closed. (Not yet implemented)
- When the maximum number of outbound connections has been reached, a random
peer is checked every minute (only Noise handcheck).

#### Unverified Peers

The unverified pool is composed of 1024 buckets of up to 64 peers, resulting in
a maximum capacity of 65536 peers.

To prevent a rogue node to fill it with compromised peers, it uses the address
group of the node gossiping the peers to select a subset of the buckets; then
the added peer address group is used to select a smaller subset and then the
rest of the address is finally used to select the bucket it belongs to.
A secret known only by the node is used to randomize the selection process
so it cannot be predicted by the attacker.

If a peer is not already in the verified pool, the steps to add it to the
unverified pool are:

1. If there is already 8 references of the peer in the pool, no more
references are added; if there is N references, a random probability check of
'1/2^N' is performed to decide if another reference to the peer should be added.
2. A subset of 64 buckets are selected based on the secret and the group of the
node that gossiped the peer (IP '/16' mask); this limits the part of the pool
that can be changed by any given rogue node IP.
3. From this subset, 4 buckets are selected based on the secret and the IP of
the peer to be added; this randomizes the peer distribution preventing the
prediction of the way peers will be evicted.
4. From these 4 buckets, a single one is selected randomly; this reduces the
collisions between peers that share the same IP.
5. If the bucket already contains a reference to the peer, it is not added again.
6. If the bucket the peer has to be added to is full, one existing peer has to
be evicted. This is done by first cleaning all the peers that weren't gossiped
for a certain amount of time, then if the bucket is still full, by selecting a
random peer with a bias favoring peers that were added the longest time ago.
7. The eventually evicted peer is completely removed from the pool.

Only the IP of the peers are used to select a subset of the pool because
IP is an expensive resource while ports are comparatively cheap.

See [Bucket Selection](#bucket-selection) for more details on how the buckets
are selected from the secret and other discriminators.

#### Verified Peers

The verified pool is composed of 256 buckets of up to 32 peers, resulting in a
maximum capacity of 8192 peers.

To prevent attackers from predicting how good peers are evicted and replace them
by compromised peers, the eviction is done per-bucket; the buckets are selected
from the peer address and a secret to randomize the selection process.

When a peer is verified the first time by connecting to it using the Noise
protocol, it is removed from the unverified pool and the steps to add it to
the verified pool are:

1. A subset of 8 buckets are selected based on the secret and the address group
of the peer to be added.
2. From this subset, a single bucket is selected based on the secret and the
rest of the IP of the peer to be added.
3. If the bucket is full, one peer has to be evicted. This is done by first
cleaning the peers that weren't gossiped for a long time, and if the bucket is
still full, by selecting a random one with a bias toward the ones that are not
connected and the last connection was the longest time ago. Trusted peers and
connected peers are never evicted.
4. The eventually evicted peer is added to the unverified pool; its retry
counter and last retry time are reset.

See [Bucket Selection](#bucket-selection) for more details on how the buckets
are selected from the secret and other discriminators.

With these default values:

- The maximum cumulated number of distinct peers in the pools is from
16384 to 73728 depending on peer duplication in the unverified pool.
- The maximum number of peers that can be added through gossip by peers sharing
the same address group is from 512 to 4096 depending on peer duplication in the
unverified pool.
- The maximum number of neighboring peers sharing the same IP a single node
can add through gossip is from 23 to 184 depending on peer duplication in the
unverified pool.
- The minimum time to reach 10 outbound connections is 2 minutes and 31 seconds.

##### Bucket Selection

The bucket selection is done by hashing the secret with the discriminator and
use the result as an integer; this integer modulo is used to restrict the
subset.

For the unverified bucket selection:

```Erlang
<<N1:160>> = crypto:hash(sha, <<Secret/binary, PeerGroup/binary>>).
<<N2:160>> = crypto:hash(sha, <<Secret/binary, PeerAddress/binary>>).
<<N3:160>> = crypto:hash(sha, <<Secret/binary, SourceGroup/binary, (N1 rem 16):8, (N2 rem 4):8>>).
BucketIdx = N3 rem 1024.
```

For the verified bucket selection:

```Erlang
<<N1:160>> = crypto:hash(sha, <<Secret/binary, PeerAddress/binary>>).
<<N2:160>> = crypto:hash(sha, <<Secret/binary, PeerGroup/binary, (N1 rem 8):8>>).
BucketIdx = N2 rem 256.
```

#### Persistence

(Not yet implemented)

Persistence of the known peers is important in preventing Sybil/eclipse attacks.

If the node rebuild its list of peers from scratch every time it is restarted,
an attacker could use any other attack vector to crash the node or wait for
a scheduled restart and be the first to spam it with compromised addresses.

To support persistence, both verified and unverified pools are dumped to disk
periodically and loaded on startup.
