# Ã†ternity epoch node API

This document:
* Provides an overview of the API exposed by the epoch node;
* Defines the WebSocket API of the epoch node;
* Defines the Channels WebSocket API of the epoch node;
* Describes the intended usage of the user API of the epoch node.

## Overview

The epoch node exposes the following APIs:
* Peer-to-peer network API. It consists of one TCP endpoint:
  * It is encrypted and authenticated using the Noise protocol;
  * It is not yet defined in a document. Advanced users may inspect the `aec_peer_connection` module;
  * It is meant to be exposed on the Internet;
  * Its TCP port is configurable.
* User API. It consists of the following TCP endpoints:
  * External HTTP endpoint;
    * It is defined via Swagger schema;
    * It is meant to be exposed on the Internet;
    * Its TCP port is configurable.
  * Internal HTTP endpoint;
    * It is defined via Swagger schema;
    * It is **not** meant to be exposed on the Internet;
    * Its TCP port is configurable.
  * Internal WebSocket endpoint.
    * It is defined in the rest of this document;
    * It is **not** meant to be exposed on the Internet;
    * Its TCP port is configurable.
  * External Channels WebSocket endpoint.
    * It is defined in the rest of this document;
    * It is meant to be exposed on the Internet;
    * Its TCP port is configurable.

## WebSocket API definition

### Connection
The epoch node supports an endpoint with a configurable port where the
websocket's clients connect. It is located on `/websocket`.

The node could serve multiple websocket clients. Their number is configured in
the epoch.yaml. When all websocket connections are consumed - any new incoming
connections will be queued. The queue has a maximum size and when it is
reached - any new incoming connections will be rejected with an error code 400.
This is to prevent the node of being overloaded with websocket connections.

### Subscription to events

Websocket clients will receive updates to events they've subscribed to. A
client can subscribe (and unsubscribe) to events on the fly. Subscribe is
described in [Chain WS API - Subscribe](./chain_ws_api.md#subscribe) and an
example usage for oracles can be seen in [Oracle user API usage](./oracle_api_usage.md).

### General Request/Response/Event types
A request has the format:

| Name | Type | Description | Required |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- | -------- |
| target | string | what component to target | Yes |
| action | string | what is the action | Yes |
| tag | string | tag to be included in response | No |
| payload | object | data for action | Yes |

A response has the format:

| Name | Type | Description | Required |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- | -------- |
| origin | string | what component did the action | Yes |
| action | string | what was the action | Yes |
| tag | string | tag from request (or `untagged`) | Yes |
| payload | object | data from the action | Yes |

An event has the same type as a response, except for not having a tag:

| Name | Type | Description | Required |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- | -------- |
| origin | string | what component did the action | Yes |
| action | string | what was the action | Yes |
| payload | object | data from the action | Yes |

## Channels WebSocket API definition

### Description
Channels provide means for off chain transactions with functionality of on
chain dispute resolution.
Channels require persisted connections to Aeternity nodes. Each participant in
a channels uses one's own trusted node. For persistence of this connection websockets
are used.
Channels have on chain state that persists who the participants are and the
total amout of tokens put in the channel.
Each channel also has an off chain state representing the latest distribution of the balance of the
channel. It can be updates - each new state is co-signed by both parties and only then it becomes the latest valid state of the
channel. At any point of time channel can be closed either unilaterally or
with a mutual agreement.

### Connection
The epoch node supports an endpoint with a configurable port where the
websocket's clients connect. It is located on `/channel`.

The node could serve multiple channel websocket clients. Their number is configured in
the `epoch.yaml`. When all websocket connections are consumed - any new incoming
connections will be queued. The queue has a maximum size and when it is
reached - any new incoming connections will be rejected with an error code 400.
This is to prevent the node of being overloaded with websocket connections.

### General message types
All messages have the format:

| Name | Type | Description | Required |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- | -------- |
| action | string | what is the action | Yes |
| tag | string | additional info for the action | No |
| payload | object | data for action | Yes |
