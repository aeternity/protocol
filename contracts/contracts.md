# Smart Contracts

## Overview and definitions

- A smart **Contract** is a program on the blockchain that lives in the **contract state tree** in a full node.
- A contract runs on a virtual machine.
- A contract is owned by an **contract owner**.
- The contract owner creates a contract through posting a **create contract transaction** on the chain.
- Alternatively an owner can attach a contract to an existing account through an **attach contract transaction**.
- The contract creation transaction register an account as a contract. (One account - one contract)
- No one will have the private key for accounts created with create contract.
- Any user can call an exported function in a contract by posting a  **contract call transaction** on the chain.
- Contract can be written in a high level language which is compiled to the VM byte code.

## Goals

The overreaching functional goal of Æternity smart contracts is to be able to execute
code on the chain. That is, code execution that is verified by a miner and
which can alter the state of the chain.

The design and implementation of the Æternity smart contracts also have the following
non-functional goals in the following order:

1. Contract execution should be safe.
2. Contract execution should be efficient and scale.
3. Contract execution should be cheap.
4. There should be a simple way to migrate from Ethereum smart contracts.

### Goal 1: Contract execution should be safe

With safe contracts we mean that you can specify and automatically prove properties of your contract.

In order to achieve this we have designed a new functional language Sophia and a new
safe virtual machine FTWVM.

### Goal 2: Contract execution should be efficient and scale

In order to achieve a scalable solution Æternity provides State Channels and
a new consensus algorithm.

To get efficient contract execution Æternity provides a very high level language
for blindingly fast execution of simple contracts. For more advanced contract
the Sophia language can be used. Sophia is compiled to a virtual machine that
is tailored for the execution of Sophia contracts. This machine is also high level
machine with instructions for operating on the chain and on Sophia data structures
without the need to do explicit stack and memory management.

### Goal 3: Contract execution should be cheap

The price of contract execution will ultimately be determined by miners and users,
but by providing State channels, efficient ways to execute contracts, and a simple flat
rate high level contract language prices should be kept low.

### Goal 4. There should be a simple way to migrate from Ethereum smart contracts
By providing a version of the EVM it is easy to migrate EVM contracts to Æternity.



## [Contract life cycle examples](./contract_life_cycle.md)

There is no kill instruction in the Æternity virtual machine, instead there is a deactivation instruction.
When a contract is disabled it can only be called from other contracts already created on the chain.
One can not create a new contract on the chain that calls a disabled contract neither directly nor indirectly.

A typically contract life cycle looks like this:
1. Contract A with a function f is created by owner O.
2. Anyone can call the function f in A (call A.f()) any number of times.
3. Another contract B that refers to A.f is created.
4. Contract A is deactivated by O.
5. No one can call A directly any more, and no new contract can refer to contracts A and B, but calls through B still go to A.f.
6. Contract B is deactivated by its owner, and has no referring contracts, it is deallocated as is contract A. (removed form the contract state tree)

## [Aeternity VMs](./contract_vms.md)

Æternity plan to support multiple virtual machines.
In order to make transition from Ethereum easy the first VM (AEVM) will be very similar to the EVM.
A field in the contract specifies which virtual machine to be used.
In the future we plan to provide at least one more virtual machine which addresses some of the
security issues with the EVM.

For more information see [Aeternity VMs](./contract_vms.md)

## [Sophia: The first contract language](https://github.com/aeternity/aesophia)

Sophia is a functional OCaml like language which syntax most resembles that of Reason.

## Technical aspects of Contract operations

### Contracts have a published API

The API defines the format that calls should have.

### Contracts are typed

There are 4 basic types (uint, address, string, bool), 4 composed
types (tuple, list, record, map), and 3 block chain specific types
(state, transactions and events).
