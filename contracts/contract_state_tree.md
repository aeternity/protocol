## Contract state tree

The contracts and their interactions reside in an contract state tree that
is included in the root hash. The existence of an contract and the
existence of query/response will have to be proven when two parites
contract with eachother.

### Contract state tree objects

The contract state tree contains three types of objects:
- The contract definition
- The contract store
- The contract log

#### The contract definition

- Created by an contract register transaction.
- Deleted when an inactive contract has no more referers.


### Contract state tree update



### Pruning of contracts
