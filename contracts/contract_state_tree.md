## Contract state tree

The contracts and their interactions reside in a contract state tree that
is included in the root hash. The existence of a contract and the
existence of calls can be proven.

### Contract state tree objects

The contract state tree contains three types of objects:
- The contract definition
- The contract store
- The contract log

As well as normal account fields.

#### The contract definition

- Created by a contract create transaction.
- Deleted when an inactive contract has no more referers.
