## The Sophia Language
An Æternity BlockChain Language
The Sophia is a language in the ML family. It is strongly typed and has
restricted mutable state.

Sophia is customized for smart contracts, which can be published
to a blockchain (the Æternity BlockChain). Thus some features of conventional
languages, such as floating point arithmetic, are not present in Sophia, and
some blockchain specific primitives, constructions and types have been added.
