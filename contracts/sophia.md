## The Sophia Language
An Æternity BlockChain Language
The Sophia is a language in the ML family. It is strongly typed and has
restricted mutable state.

Sophia is customized for smart contracts, which can be published
to a blockchain (the Æternity BlockChain). Thus some features of conventional
languages, such as floating point arithmetic, are not present in Sophia, and
some blockchain specific primitives, constructions and types have been added.

## Language Features
### Contracts

Sophia does not have modules. Instead sophia has static
contracts. Contracts are similar to classes in object oriented
languages and support local state and inheritance. More specifically:

- A contract implementation, or simply a contract, is the code for a
  smart contract and consists of a list of types and functions that
  may or may not have a definition. A contract where all types and
  functions are defined is called a concrete contract. Only concrete
  contracts can be instantiated. (Used in a create contract transaction.)

- A contract can be abstract where no types or functions have definitions. Example:

```javascript
// An abstract contract
contract VotingType =
  public stateful function vote : string => ()
```

- A contract instance is an entity living on the block chain (or in a state channel). Each
instance is associated with a particular contract implementation (at
least from the view of high-level language; the low-level details of
how to store and check API information on the chain is still to be
worked out).
- A contract may define a type state encapsulating its local
  state. The state must be initialised when instantiating a
  contract. This is done by the init function which can take arbitrary
  arguments and is called on contract instance creation.
- Contracts have a public API, comprising the functions and types
  annotated with the public keyword. These can be used from outside
  the contract. Functions and types with no annotation (or internal)
  are part of the internal API and can be used by contracts inheriting
  (see below) the given contract. Functions and types annotated with
  private can only be used locally.
- Contracts can inherit one (or more?) other contract(s). In this case
  the public functions (and types) of the inherited contract are
  included in the public API and internal functions are included in
  the internal API of the current contract. The state of the contract
  contains the states of all inherited contracts as well as the local
  state. However, the state of an inherited contract cannot be
  accessed other than through internal functions defined by that
  contract.
- Open question: should we allow overriding defined functions? I would
  suggest no, but there might be compelling use cases that I'm
  missing.

*NOTE: Contract inheritance is not yet implemented.*

#### Calling other contracts

To call a function in another contract you need the address to an instance of
the contract. The type of the address is a (possibly abstract) contract. For
instance, given the `VotingType` contract above we can define a contract

```javascript
contract VoteTwice =
  public function voteTwice(v : VotingType, alt : string) =
    v.vote(alt)
    v.vote(alt)
```

Contract calls take two optional named arguments `gas : int` and `value : int`
that lets you set a gas limit and provide tokens to a contract call. If omitted
the defaults are no gas limit and no tokens. Suppose there is a fee for voting:

```javascript
  function voteTwice(v : VotingType, fee : int, alt : string) =
    v.vote(value = fee, alt)
    v.vote(value = fee, alt)
```

Named arguments can be given in any order.

To recover the underlying address of a contract instance there is a field
`address : address`. For instance, to send tokens to the voting contract
without calling it you can write

```javascript
  function pay(v : VotingType, amount : int) =
    Chain.spend(v.address, amount)
```

Note that reentrant calls are not permitted. In other words, when calling
another contract it cannot call you back.

### Mutable state

Sophia does not have arbitrary mutable state, but only a limited form of
state associated with each contract instance.

- Each contract defines a type `state` encapsulating its mutable state.
- The initial state of a contract is computed by the contract's `init`
  function. The `init` function is *pure* and returns the initial state as its
  return value. At contract creation time, the `init` function is executed and
  its result is stored as the contract state.
- The value of the state is accessible from inside the contract
  through an implicitly bound variable `state`.
- State updates are performed by calling a function `put : state => ()`.
- Aside from the `put` function (and similar functions for transactions
  and events), the language is purely functional.
- Functions modifying the state need to be annotated with the `stateful` keyword.

To make it convenient to update parts of a deeply nested state Sophia
provides special syntax for map/record updates.  Open
question: we likely want to make it possible to have immutable state
(parameters). Keep separate from mutable state or annotate certain
fields as immutable?

### Types
Sophia has the following types:

| Type       | Description                     | Example
| ---------- | ------------------------------- | -------:
| int        | A 256 bit 2-complement integer  | ```-1```
| address    | A 256 bit number given as a hex | ```ff00```
| bool       | A Boolean                       | ```true```
| string     | An array of bytes               | ```"Foo"```
| list       | A homogeneous immutable singly linked list. | ```[1, 2, 3]```
| tuple      | An ordered heterogeneous array   | ```(42, "Foo", true)```
| record     | An immutable key value store with fixed key names and typed values | ``` record balance = { owner: address, value: int } ```
| map        | An immutable key value store with dynamic mapping of keys of one type to values of one type | ```type accounts = map(string, address)```
| option('a) | An optional value either None or Some('a) | ```Some(42)```
| state        | A record of blockstate key, value pairs  |
| transactions | An append only list of blockchain transactions |
| events       | An append only list of blockchain events (or log entries) |
| signature    | A signature - 64 bytes |
| Chain.ttl    | Time-to-live (fixed height or relative to current block) | ```FixedTTL(1050)``` ```RelativeTTL(50)```
| oracle('a, 'b)       | And oracle answering questions of type 'a with answers of type 'b |  ```Oracle.register(acct, qfee, ttl)```
| oracle_query('a, 'b) | A specific oracle query |  ```Oracle.query(o, q, qfee, qttl, rttl)```

### Type aliases

Type aliases can be introduced with the `type` keyword and can be
parameterized. For instance

```
type number = int
type string_map('a) = map(string, 'a)
```

A type alias and its definition can be used interchangeably.

### Algebraic data types

Sophia supports algebraic data types (variant types) and pattern matching. Data
types can be recursive and are declared by giving a list of constructors with
their respective arguments. For instance, the following defines a type of
binary trees parameterised over the element type:

```
datatype tree('a) = Tip | Bin(tree('a), 'a, tree('a))
```

Elements of data types can be pattern matched against, using the `switch` construct:

```
function root(t : tree('a)) : option('a) =
  switch(t)
    Tip => None
    Bin(_, v, _) => Some(v)
```

*NOTE: Recursive data types are not yet implemented*

### Lists

A Sophia list is a dynamically sized, homogenous, immutable, singly
linked list. A list is constructed with the syntax `[1, 2, 3]`. The
elements of a list can be any of datatype but they must have the same
type. The type of lists with elements of type `'e` is written
`list('e)`. For example we can have the following lists:

```
[1, 33, 2, 666]                                                   : list(int)
[(1, "aaa"), (10, "jjj"), (666, "the beast")]                     : list((int, string))
[{[1] = "aaa", [10] = "jjj"}, {[5] = "eee", [666] = "the beast"}] : list(map(int, string))
```

New elements can be prepended to the front of a list with the `::`
operator. So `42 :: [1, 2, 3]` returns the list `[42, 1, 2, 3]`. The
concatenation operator `++` appends its second argument to its first
and returns the resulting list. So concatenating two lists
`[1, 22, 33] ++ [10, 18, 55]` returns the list `[1, 22, 33, 10, 18, 55]`.

### Maps and records

A Sophia record type is given by a fixed set of fields with associated,
possibly different, types. For instance
```
  record account = { name    : string,
                     balance : int,
                     history : list(transaction) }
```

Maps, on the other hand, can contain an arbitrary number of key-value bindings,
but of a fixed type. The type of maps with keys of type `'k` and values of type
`'v` is written `map('k, 'v)`. The key type can be any type that does not
contain a map or a function type.

#### Constructing maps and records

A value of record type is constructed by giving a value for each of the fields.
For the example above,
```
  function new_account(name) =
    {name = name, balance = 0, history = []}
```
Maps are constructed similarly, with keys enclosed in square brackets
```
  function example_map() : map(string, int) =
    {["key1"] = 1, ["key2"] = 2}
```
The empty map is written `{}`.

#### Accessing values

Record fields access is written `r.f` and map lookup `m[k]`. For instance,
```
  function get_balance(a : address, accounts : map(address, account)) =
    accounts[a].balance
```
Looking up a non-existing key in a map results in contract execution failing. A
default value to return for non-existing keys can be provided using the syntax
`m[k = default]`. See also `Map.member` and `Map.lookup` below.

#### Updating a value

Record field updates are written `r{f = v}`. This creates a new record value
which is the same as `r`, but with the value of the field `f` replaced by `v`.
Similarly, `m{[k] = v}` constructs a map with the same values as `m` except
that `k` maps to `v`. It makes no difference if `m` has a mapping for `k` or
not.

It is possible to give a name to the old value of a field or mapping in an
update: instead of `acc{ balance = acc.balance + 100 }` it is possible to write
`acc{ balance @ b = b + 100 }`, binding `b` to `acc.balance`. When giving a
name to a map value (`m{ [k] @ x = v }`), the corresponding key must be present
in the map or execution fails, but a default value can be provided:
`m{ [k = default] @ x = v }`. In this case `x` is bound to `default` if
`k` is not in the map.

Updates can be nested:
```
function clear_history(a : address, accounts : map(address, account)) : map(address, account) =
  accounts{ [a].history = [] }
```
This is equivalent to `accounts{ [a] @ acc = acc{ history = [] } }` and thus
requires `a` to be present in the accounts map. To have `clear_history` create
an account if `a` is not in the map you can write (given a function `empty_account`):
```
  accounts{ [a = empty_account()].history = [] }
```


#### Builtin functions on maps

The following builtin functions are defined on maps:

```
  Map.lookup(k : 'k, m : map('k, 'v)) : option('v)
  Map.lookup_default(k : 'k, m : map('k, 'v), v : 'v) : 'v
  Map.member(k : 'k, m : map('k, 'v)) : bool
  Map.delete(k : 'k, m : map('k, 'v)) : map('k, 'v)
  Map.size(m : map('k, 'v)) : int
  Map.to_list(m : map('k, 'v)) : list(('k, 'v))
  Map.from_list(m : list(('k, 'v))) : map('k, 'v)
```

#### Map implementation

Internally in the VM maps are implemented as hash maps and support fast lookup
and update. Large maps can be stored in the contract state and the size of the
map does not contribute to the gas costs of a contract call reading or updating
it.

### Strings

There is a builtin type `string`, which can be seen as an array of bytes.
Strings can be compared for equality (`==`, `!=`), used as keys in maps and
records, and used in builtin functions `String.length`, `String.concat` and
`String.sha3`.

#### Builtin functions on strings

The following builtin functions are defined on strings:

```
  String.length(s : string) : int
  String.concat(s1 : string, s2 : string) : string
  String.sha3(s : string) : int
```
#### Builtin functions on integers

The following builtin functions are defined on integers:

```
  Int.to_str(i : int) : string
```

#### Builtin functions on addresses

The following builtin functions are defined on addresses:

```
  Address.to_str(a : address) : string  // Base58 encoded string
```

### Builtins

#### Account interface

To spend tokens from the contract account to the account "to" you call the `Chain.spend` function.

```
Chain.spend(to : address, amount : integer)
```

#### Oracle interface
You can attach an oracle to the current contract and you can interact with oracles
through the Oracle interface.

For a full description of how Oracle works see [Oracles](/oracles/oracles.md#oracles)

An Oracle operator will use the functions:
* `Oracle.register`
* `Oracle.get_question`
* `Oracle.respond`
* `Oracle.extend`

An Oracle user will use the functions:
* `Oracle.query_fee`
* `Oracle.query`
* `Oracle.get_answer`

##### Oracle register

To register a new oracle answering questions of type `'a` with answers of type `'b`,
call `Oracle.register`:
```
Oracle.register(acct       : address,
                <signature : signature>, // Signed account address + contract address
                                         // named argument (and thus optional)
                qfee       : int,
                ttl        : Chain.ttl) : oracle('a, 'b)
```

* The `acct` is the address of the oracle to register (can be the same as the contract).
* `signature` is a signature proving that the contract is allowed to register the account -
  the account address + the contract address (concatenated as byte arrays) is signed with the
  private key of the account, proving you have the private key of the oracle to be. If the
  address is the same as the contract `sign` is ignored and can be left out entirely.
* The `qfee` is the minimum query fee to be paid by a user when asking a question of the oracle.
* The `ttl` is the Time To Live for the oracle, either relative to the current
  height (`RelativeTTL(delta)`) or a fixed height (`FixedTTL(height)`).
* The type `'a` is the type of the question to ask.
* The type `'b` is the type of the oracle answers.

Examples:
```
  Oracle.register(addr0, 25, RelativeTTL(400))
  Oracle.register(addr1, 25, RelativeTTL(500), signature = sign1)
```

##### Oracle extend

To extend the TTL of an oracle, call `Oracle.extend`:
```
Oracle.extend(o          : oracle('a, 'b),
              <signature : signature>,     // Signed oracle address + contract address
                                           // named argument (and thus optional)
              ttl        : Chain.ttl) : ()
```

The `ttl` is must be a relative TTL, relative to the current oracle expiry
height. For instance, passing `RelativeTTL(100)` adds 100 blocks to the expiry
time of the oracle. The `signature` is the same as for `Oracle.register`.

##### Oracle get_question

To check what the question of a query is, use the `Oracle.get_question` function:
```
Oracle.get_question(o : oracle('a, 'b), q : oracle_query('a, 'b)) : 'a
```

##### Oracle respond

To respond to an oracle question, use the `Oracle.respond` function:
```
Oracle.respond(oracle     : oracle('a, 'b),
               query      : oracle_query('a, 'b),
               <signature : signature>,             // Signed oracle query id + contract address
                                                    // named argument (and thus optional)
               response   : 'b)
```

Unless the contract address is the same as the oracle address the `signature`
needs to be provided. Proving that we have the private key of the oracle by
signing the oracle query id + contract address.

##### Oracle query

To ask an oracle a question, use the `Oracle.query` function:
```
Oracle.query(o    : oracle('a, 'b),
             q    : 'a,
             qfee : int,
             qttl : Chain.ttl,
             rttl : Chain.ttl) : oracle_query('a, 'b)
```

* The `qfee` is the query fee debited to the contract account (`Contract.address`).
* The `qttl` controls the last height at which the oracle can submit a response
  and can be either fixed or relative.
* The `rttl` must be relative and controls how long an answer is kept on the chain.
* The call fails if the oracle could expire before an answer.

##### Oracle query_fee

To ask the oracle what the query fee is, use the `Oracle.query_fee` function:
```
Oracle.query_fee(o : oracle('a, 'b)) : int
```

##### Oracle get_answer

To ask the oracle what the optional query answer is, use the `Oracle.get_answer` function:
```
Oracle.get_answer(o : oracle('a, 'b), q : oracle_query('a, 'b)) : option('b)
```

##### Example

Example for an oracle answering questions of type `string` with answers of type `int`:
```
contract Oracles =

  function registerOracle(acct : address,
                          sign : signature,   // Signed oracle address + contract address
                          qfee : int,
                          ttl  : Chain.ttl) : oracle(string, int) =
     Oracle.register(acct, signature = sign, qfee, ttl)

  function queryFee(o : oracle(string, int)) : int =
    Oracle.query_fee(o)

  // Do not use in production!
  function unsafeCreateQuery(o    : oracle(string, int),
                       q    : string,
                       qfee  : int,
                       qttl : Chain.ttl,
                       rttl : int) : oracle_query(string, int) =
    Oracle.query(o, q, qfee, qttl, RelativeTTL(rttl))

  function extendOracle(o    : oracle(string, int),
                        ttl  : Chain.ttl) : () =
    Oracle.extend(o, ttl)

  function signExtendOracle(o    : oracle(string, int),
                            sign : signature,   // Signed oracle address + contract address
                            ttl  : Chain.ttl) : () =
    Oracle.extend(o, signature = sign, ttl)

  function respond(o    : oracle(string, int),
                   q    : oracle_query(string, int),
                   sign : signature,        // Signed oracle query id + contract address
                   r    : int) =
    Oracle.respond(o, q, signature = sign, r)

  function getQuestion(o : oracle(string, int),
                       q : oracle_query(string, int)) : string =
    Oracle.get_question(o, q)

  function hasAnswer(o : oracle(string, int),
                     q : oracle_query(string, int)) =
    switch(Oracle.get_answer(o, q))
      None    => false
      Some(_) => true

  function getAnswer(o : oracle(string, int),
                     q : oracle_query(string, int)) : option(int) =
    Oracle.get_answer(o, q)
```

#### AENS interface

The following primitives are available for interacting with the Aeternity
Naming System (AENS):

- Name resolution
  ```
  AENS.resolve(name : string, key : string) : option('a)
  ```
  Here `name` should be a registered name and `key` one of the attributes
  associated with this name (for instance `"account_pubkey"`). The return type
  (`'a`) must be resolved at compile time to an atomic type and the value is
  type checked against this type at run time.
- AENS transactions
  ```
  AENS.preclaim(owner : address, commitment_hash : hash, <signature : signature>) : ()
  AENS.claim   (owner : address, name : string, salt : int, <signature : signature>) : ()
  AENS.transfer(owner : address, new_owner : address, name_hash : hash, <signature : signature>) : ()
  AENS.revoke  (owner : address, name_hash : hash, <signature : signature>) : ()
  ```
  If `owner` is equal to `Contract.address` the signature `signature` is
  ignored, and can be left out since it is a named argument. Otherwise we need
  a signature to prove that we are allowed to do AENS operations on behalf of
  `owner`. For `AENS.preclaim` the signature should be over owner address +
  Contract.address (concatenated as byte arrays), for the other three
  operations the signature should be over owner address + `name_hash` +
  Contract.address using the private key of the `owner` account for signing.

#### Events

Sophia contracts log structured messages to an event log in the resulting
blockchain transaction. The event log is quite similar to [Events in
Solidity](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.4.24/contracts.html#events). To
use events a contract must declare a datatype `event`, and events are then
logged using the `Chain.event` function:

```
  datatype event =
      Event1(indexed int, indexed int, string)
    | Event2(string, indexed address)

  Chain.event(e : event) : ()
```

The event can have 0-3 `indexed` fields, they should have a type that is
equivalent to a 32-byte word (i.e. `bool`, `int`, or `address`, or an alias for
such a type). To index a `string` you can use the hash function
`String.sha3(s)`. The event also has (optional) payload (not indexed), that is
of type `string`.

*NOTE:* Indexing is not part of the core aeternity node, but the `indexed` tag
should serve as a hint to any software analysing the contract call transactions.

#### Contract primitives

The block-chain environment available to a contract is defined in three name spaces
`Contract`, `Call`, and `Chain`:

- `Contract.creator` is the address of the entity that signed the contract creation
  transaction.
- `Contract.address` is the address of the contract account.
- `Contract.balance` is the amount of coins currently in the contract account.
  Equivalent to `Chain.balance(Contract.address)`.
- `Call.origin` is the address of the account that signed the call transaction that led to this call.
- `Call.caller` is the address of the entity (possibly another contract)
  calling the contract.
- `Call.value` is the amount of coins transferred to the contract in the call.
- `Call.gas_price` is the gas price of the current call.
- `Call.gas_left()` is the amount of gas left for the current call.
- `Chain.balance(a : address)` returns the balance of account `a`.
- `Chain.block_hash(h)` returns the hash of the block at height `h`.
- `Chain.block_height` is the height of the current block (i.e. the block in which the current call will be included).
- `Chain.coinbase` is the address of the account that mined the current block.
- `Chain.timestamp` is the timestamp of the current block.
- `Chain.difficulty` is the difficulty of the current block.
- `Chain.gas_limit` is the gas limit of the current block.

### Exceptions

Contracts can fail with an (uncatchable) exception using the built-in function

```
abort(reason : string) : 'a
```

Calling abort causes the top-level call transaction to return an error result
containing the `reason` string. Only the gas used up to and including the abort
call is charged. This is different from termination due to a crash which
consumes all available gas.

## Syntax

### Lexical syntax

#### Comments

Single line comments start with `//` and block comments are enclosed in `/*`
and `*/` and can be nested.

#### Keywords

```
and band bnot bor bsl bsr bxor contract elif else false function if import
internal let mod private public rec stateful switch true type record datatype
```

#### Tokens

- `Id = [a-z_][A-Za-z0-9_']*` identifiers start with a lower case letter.
- `Con = [A-Z][A-Za-z0-9_']*` constructors start with an upper case letter.
- `QId = (Con\.)+Id` qualified identifiers (e.g. `Map.member`)
- `QCon = (Con\.)+Con` qualified constructor
- `TVar = 'Id` type variable (e.g `'a`, `'b`)
- `Int = [0-9]+|0x[0-9A-Fa-f]+` integer literal
- `Hash = #[0-9A-Fa-f]+` hash literal
- `String` string literal enclosed in `"` with escape character `\`
- `Char` character literal enclosed in `'` with escape character `\`

### Layout blocks

Sophia uses Python-style layout rules to group declarations and statements. A
layout block with more than one element must start on a separate line and be
indented more than the currently enclosing layout block. Blocks with a single
element can be written on the same line as the previous token.

Each element of the block must share the same indentation and no part of an
element may be indented less than the indentation of the block. For instance

```
contract Layout =
  function foo() = 0  // no layout
  function bar() =    // layout block starts on next line
    let x = foo()     // indented more than 2 spaces
    x
     + 1              // the '+' is indented more than the 'x'
```

### Notation

In describing the syntax below, we use the following conventions:
- Upper-case identifiers denote non-terminals (like `Expr`) or terminals with
  some associated value (like `Id`).
- Keywords and symbols are enclosed in single quotes: `'let'` or `'='`.
- Choices are separated by vertical bars: `|`.
- Optional elements are enclosed in `[` square brackets `]`.
- `(` Parentheses `)` are used for grouping.
- Zero or more repetitions are denoted by a postfix `*`, and one or more
  repetitions by a `+`.
- `Block(X)` denotes a layout block of `X`s.
- `Sep(X, S)` is short for `[X (S X)*]`, i.e. a possibly empty sequence of `X`s
  separated by `S`s.
- `Sep1(X, S)` is short for `X (S X)*`, i.e. same as `Sep`, but must not be empty.


### Declarations

A Sophia file consists of a sequence of *declarations* in a layout block.

```c
File ::= Block(Decl)
Decl ::= 'contract' Con '=' Block(Decl)
       | 'type'     Id ['(' TVar* ')'] ['=' TypeAlias]
       | 'record'   Id ['(' TVar* ')'] '=' RecordType
       | 'datatype' Id ['(' TVar* ')'] '=' DataType
       | Modifier* 'function' Id ':' Type
       | Modifier* 'function' Id Args [':' Type] '=' Block(Stmt)

Modifier ::= 'stateful' | 'public' | 'private' | 'internal'

Args ::= '(' Sep(Arg, ',') ')'
Arg  ::= Id [':' Type]
```

Contract declarations must appear at the top-level.

For example,
```
contract Test =
  type t = int
  public function add (x : t, y : t) = x + y
```

There are three forms of type declarations: type aliases (declared with the
`type` keyword), record type definitions (`record`) and data type definitions
(`datatype`):

```c
TypeAlias  ::= Type
RecordType ::= '{' Sep(FieldType, ',') '}'
DataType   ::= Sep1(ConDecl, '|')

FieldType  ::= Id ':' Type
ConDecl    ::= Con ['(' Sep1(Type, ',') ')']
```

For example,
```
record   point('a) = {x : 'a, y : 'a}
datatype shape('a) = Circle(point('a), 'a) | Rect(point('a), point('a))
type     int_shape = shape(int)
```

### Types

```c
Type ::= Domain '=>' Type             // Function type
       | Type '(' Sep(Type, ',') ')'  // Type application
       | '(' Type ')'                 // Parens
       | Id | QId | TVar

Domain ::= Type                       // Single argument
         | '(' Sep(Type, ',') ')'     // Multiple arguments
```

The function type arrow associates to the right.

Example,
```
'a => list('a) => (int, list('a))
```

### Statements

Function bodies are blocks of *statements*, where a statement is one of the following

```c
Stmt ::= 'switch' '(' Expr ')' Block(Case)
       | 'if' '(' Expr ')' Block(Stmt)
       | 'elif' '(' Expr ')' Block(Stmt)
       | 'else' Block(Stmt)
       | 'let' LetDef
       | 'let' 'rec' Sep1(LetDef, 'and')  // (Mutually) recursive binding
       | Expr

LetDef ::= Id [Args] [':' Type] '=' Block(Stmt)

Case    ::= Pattern '=>' Block(Stmt)
Pattern ::= Expr
```

`if` statements can be followed by zero or more `elif` statements and an optional final `else` statement. For example,

```
let x : int = 4
switch(f(x))
  None => 0
  Some(y) =>
    if(y > 10)
      "too big"
    elif(y < 3)
      "too small"
    else
      "just right"
```

### Expressions

```c
Expr ::= '(' Args ')' '=>' Block(Stmt)      // Anonymous function    (x) => x + 1
       | 'if' '(' Expr ')' Expr 'else' Expr // If expression         if(x < y) y else x
       | Expr ':' Type                      // Type annotation       5 : int
       | Expr BinOp Expr                    // Binary operator       x + y
       | UnOp Expr                          // Unary operator        ! b
       | Expr '(' Sep(Expr, ',') ')'        // Application           f(x, y)
       | Expr '.' Id                        // Projection            state.x
       | Expr '[' Expr ']'                  // Map lookup            map[key]
       | Expr '{' Sep(FieldUpdate, ',') '}' // Record or map update  r{ fld[key].x = y }
       | '[' Sep(Expr, ',') ']'             // List                  [1, 2, 3]
       | '{' Sep(FieldUpdate, ',') '}'      // Record or map value   {x = 0, y = 1}, {[key] = val}
       | '(' Expr ')'                       // Parens                (1 + 2) * 3
       | Id | Con | QId | QCon              // Identifiers           x, None, Map.member, AELib.Token
       | Int | Hash | String | Char         // Literals              123, 0xff, #00abc123, "foo", '%'

FieldUpdate ::= Path '=' Expr
Path ::= Id                 // Record field
       | '[' Expr ']'       // Map key
       | Path '.' Id        // Nested record field
       | Path '[' Expr ']'  // Nested map key

BinOp ::= '||' | '&&' | '<' | '>' | '=<' | '>=' | '==' | '!='
        | '::' | '++' | '+' | '-' | '*' | '/' | 'mod' | '^'
        | 'bor' | 'bxor' | 'band' | 'bsr' | bsl'
UnOp  ::= '-' | '!' | 'bnot'
```

## The lifetime of a contract

### Killing a contract

There is no selfdestruct instruction in the aevm as in the Ethereum
Virtual Machine instead there is a disable transaction which the
creator of a contract can issue. When a contract is disabled no new
contract can call the old contract.

When a contract is posted to the chain all references to other
contracts are checked and a reference counter in each contract is
increased. You can only post a contract to the chain if all the
contracts referred to are enabled.

When a contract is disabled all other contracts it refer to get their
reference count decreased.

If a contract is disabled and its reference count is zero a miner can
choose to garbage collect the contract.

The reference count of a contract is handled as the account balance
and kept in the state tree of the miner and the merkle hash is
included in the state hash in each block just as with balances.

The transaction for creating a contract has an extra fee called
deposit which has to be an even number. The disable transaction is
free but the miner and the creator get half of the deposit fee each at
contract disable thus encouraging creators to disable their contracts
and miners to pick disable transactions.

## The Sophia\_01 ABI

### Byte code

The byte code contains meta data about the original sophia source
code.

#### Meta data
The byte code contains meta data for the contract.
- source_code_hash - a sha256 hash of the source code string of the contract
- type_info - see Type information below
- byte_code - the actual byte code

The layout of the encoding can be found
[here](../serializations.md#sophia-byte-code). The encoding is tagged
with the compiler version.

#### Type information
The type information of each function is encoded in the meta data. The function
hash depends both on the function name and the type signature of the function.
The function hash is also the identifier of a function when calling a contract.
In this way, the function prototype in the calling function gets some level of
type verification.

The type information contains:
- fun_hash - A sha256 hash of the function name and the function types
- fun_name - The function name as a string
- arg_type - The vm encoded typerep of the argument (as a tuple) of the function
- out_type - The vm encoded typerep of the return type of the function

### Memory layout

Sophia values are 256-bit words. In case of unboxed types (`int`,
`address`, and `bool`) this is simply the value. For boxed types
such as tuples and (non-empty) lists, the word is a pointer into the heap
(memory).

More precisely

- Unboxed types are represented as a single big endian 256-bit (32 bytes) word.
  Booleans are represented as 0 for `false` and 1 for `true`. The empty list is
  represented as an unboxed -1. In memory maps are represented by an unboxed
  unique identifier. The contents of the map is stored separately in the VM
  state.

- Boxed types are represented as a 256-bit pointer to a contiguous sequence of
  words, called a *heap object*, on the heap.

  | Value/Type | Heap object
  | --- | ---
  | Tuple | The value of each component in left-to-right order.
  | String | The length (number of bytes), followed by as many words as required to store the character data, padded on the right with 0.

  The following types are represented in terms of other types:

  <table>
  <tr><th>Type</th><th>Representation</th></tr>
  <tr><td>Non-empty list</td><td>A pair of the head and the tail.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Record</td><td>A tuple of the field values.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Data type</td>
      <td>A tuple where the first component is a constructor
          tag (starting with 0 for the first constructor), and the following
          components are the constructor arguments. For instance, for<br/><br/>
          <tt>datatype zeroOrTwo = Zero | Two(int, int)</tt><br/><br/>
          <tt>Zero</tt> is encoded as a singleton tuple <tt>(0)</tt> and
          <tt>Two(a, b)</tt> as the triple <tt>(1, a, b)</tt>.
      </td></tr>
  <tr><td>Signature</td><td>A pair of two 256-bit words.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Option types</td><td><tt>datatype option('a) = None | Some('a)</tt>.</td></tr>
  <tr><td><tt>ttl</tt></td><td><tt>datatype ttl = RelativeTTL(int) | FixedTTL(int)</tt></td></tr>
  <tr><td>Type representations</td>
      <td>
      When types need to be encoded as data, they are represented as the following datatype<br/><br/>
      <div>
      <pre>
        datatype typerep = Word  // any unboxed type
                         | String
                         | List(typerep)
                         | Tuple(list(typerep))
                         | Datatype(list(list(typerep)))
                         | TypeRep
                         | Map(typerep, typerep)
      </pre></div>
      The argument to the <tt>Datatype</tt> constructor is the list of type
      representations of the constructor arguments.
      </td></tr>
  </table>

### Encoding Sophia values as binaries

When communicating Sophia values between a contract and the outside world they
are encoded as a binary containing a heap whose first word is the encoded value
(except in the case of maps, see below). For example, the value `("main", (1, 2, 3))`
can be encoded as
```
Word       0       1       2       3       4       5       6       7
Addr    0x00    0x20    0x40    0x60    0x80    0xA0    0xC0    0xE0
Value   0x20    0x60    0xA0       4   "main"      1       2       3
```
where `"main"` is the 32 byte word obtained by right padding the string
`"main"` with zeroes.

Note that the order of the heap objects on the heap is unspecified. Another
valid encoding of the same value is
```
Word       0       1       2       3       4       5       6       7
Addr    0x00    0x20    0x40    0x60    0x80    0xA0    0xC0    0xE0
Value   0x60       4   "main"   0x20    0xA0       1       2       3
```

A canonical binary representation is obtained by storing heap objects in
depth-first left-to-right order (as in the first example). This is the
representation used in map keys.

#### Binary encoding of Sophia maps

In memory, maps are represented by their unique identifier, but in binary
encodings the identifier is replaced by a boxed representation with a heap
object of the shape
```
    MapSize (N)
    KeySize1
  +----------+
  |   Key1   |
  +----------+
    ValSize1
  +----------+
  |   Val1   |
  +----------+
      ...
    KeySizeN
  +----------+
  |   KeyN   |
  +----------+
    ValSizeN
  +----------+
  |   ValN   |
  +----------+
```
The keys and values are encoded as standalone binaries, so the addresses in
`KeyI` (say) are relative only to the `KeyI` binary.

### Initialization

When a Sophia contract is called the calldata should be a pair of a function
hash and a tuple of arguments, encoded as a binary as described above
The value should be a pair of a function hash and a tuple of arguments
For instance, to call the function `foo` (assuming the function
hash 12345) with arguments `1` and `"bar"`, the calldata should be
(the binary encoding of)
```
  (12345, (1, "bar"))
```
Before the contract starts executing the first word of the encoded calldata
(i.e. the calldata value) is pushed on the stack and the rest of the calldata
heap is written to memory. The result is that the Sophia contract starts with
the value of the calldata on top of the stack.

If the contract state has been initialized it is stored on the heap and a
pointer to it is written to address 0. If the contract state has not been
initialized, for instance, when running the `init` function, 0 is written to
address 0. Note that address 0 contains a *pointer* to the value of the state,
not the value itself.

The compiler is responsible for generating the appropriate dispatch code,
looking at the calldata and calling the correct function.

### Return

When returning from a contract call (using the `RETURN` instruction) the
type information from the meta data is used to encode the return value.
The VM reads the return value from the heap and returns it to the caller,
and reads the updated contract state using the state pointer at address 0.
A contract can write 0 to the state pointer to indicate that the state
did not change.

### Storing the contract state

The contract state is stored in the *store* as a binary heap whose first word
is the value (with maps stored as their identifiers) under key `0x00`.
The type of the state is stored as an encoded type representation under key
`0x01` (***subject to change: contract state type to be stored in contract
metadata***). The list of maps in the contract state is stored under key `0x02`
as a sequence of 256-bit map identifiers. For each map there are mappings
(where `[X]` denotes a single 256-bit word):
```
  [MapId]      => [RealId] [RefCount] [Size] Types
  [RealId] Key => Val
```
`Types` is the binary encoding of the tuple `(KeyType, ValType)` of type
representations for the key and value types of the map. `Key` and `Val` are
stand-alone heap encodings with map identifiers for maps (although for keys
there are no maps). The `RealId` field is an indirection to allow in-place
updates of maps and the `RefCount` field is used to track the number of
occurrences of a map in other maps for the purpose of garbage collection.

The `init` function of a contract should return a pair of the state type
representation and the initial state, which are written to the store by the VM.
Note that the Sophia code for `init` only returns the initial state value--the
compiler is responsible for adding the type representation.

### Remote contract calls

The `CALL` instruction for calling another contract works differently for
Sophia contracts than in the EVM. It expects on the stack (top to bottom):
- `Gas` - the amount of gas to allocate to the call
- `Address` - the address of the contract to call (or 0 for primops)
- `Amount` - the amount of tokens to transfer with the call
- `Calldata` - the calldata value (pair of function hash and arguments)
- `TypeHash` - the function hash of primops that have dynamic types
               (e.g., oracles). Otherwise unused.
- `_` - unused (offset to write return value in the EVM)
- `_` - unused (return value size in the EVM)

The calldata is read from the heap guided by the calldata type and passed to
the called contract. Before the call is made gas is charged for the size of the
expanded calldata (e.g. maps have to be made explicit when passed between
contracts). When the call returns the return value is pushed on top of the
stack, and potential heap objects for the return value written to the top of
the heap. The return type from the contracts meta data is used when writing it
 to the heap. Since maps are handled outside the heap, the caller explicitly
pays gas for handling maps in the return value.
