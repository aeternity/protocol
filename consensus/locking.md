# Coins locking

We want a predictable inflation so there MUST not be any coin burning. In order
to achieve this whenever there is a need for coins burning, we are locking
those excess coins. This leads to a deterministic total amount of coins and
thus - to a predictable inflation. This works as sending all to be locked
coins to a predifined address that nobody has a private key for. Those coins
are unspendable at this point.
