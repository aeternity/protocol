# Off-chain

Each party keeps a state tree specific for the channel. It represents the
channel state at a certain point of time. It consists of all the channel data:
accounts and contracts. Since it has the same structure as the on-chain state
tree, the `names` and `oracles` subtrees are empty as those are not allowed off-chain. The
`channels` subtree is empty as well, as it is reserved for future use.
Off-chain transactions update this channel auxiliary tree.

It is the responsibility of the parties to keep this locally. This is the safety
guarantee in a case of a dispute: the solo closing path requires a proof of
inclusion for subtree instead of posting the whole tree. Being able to provide
this proof of inclusion allows a participant to dispute a malicious close by
the other party or for basing a forced progress.

Each off-chain update consists of updates being applied on top of channel
state tree as well with an integer value `round` representing when it
happened. Since `round` must always be bumped, provided two off-chain
transactions we can reason which was performed earlier than the other.

## Overview

The protocol parties use to run smart contracts is a two-phase commit
protocol, where one party proposes a change, gets it authenticated by the
other and then commits the update locally. These checks are necessary to avoid
parties getting confused if updates are being proposed simultaneously.  On a
higher level, to keep off-chain and on-chain state in sync, parties should
refuse to authenticate updates for either without also getting an
authentication for the updates state_hash, e.g. don't authenticate an on-chain
`channel_deposit` transaction without also updating the channel state trees
as well.  Authentication method differences depending on whether the transaction
is on-chain or off-chain one can be found [here](./authentication.md).

With the consistency of state updates being secured between parties, it is
essential that parties make absolutely sure to not lose their local state,
since it could potentially lead to them not being able to slash outdated
states published on-chain.


## Control messages

### Framing

Each message is identified by a 1-byte message code. The size of the following
message is defined by the type â€“ see the description of each individual
message type.

```
  name                  size (bytes)
 ---------------------- ----
| msg_type             | 1  |
 ---------------------- ----
| message              | .. |
 ---------------------- ----
```

The following message codes are defined:
```
  type              code
-------------------------
| channel_open     | 1  |
| channel_accept   | 2  |
| channel_reestabl | 3  |

| shutdown         | 98 |
| shutdown_ack     | 99 |
-------------------------
```

### `error`

Message code: 97

Explicitly communicating errors should make debugging easier. In order to avoid
complex error handling, which tends to be prone to mistakes, once a channel
returns an error, it MUST be considered unusable. As such, errors SHOULD be
reserved for unrecoverable failures only.

```
  name                  size (bytes)
 ---------------------- ----
| channel_id           | 32 |
 ---------------------- ----
| length               | 2  |
 ---------------------- ----
| data                 |    |
 ---------------------- ----
```

- `channel_id`: the temporary or final channel id
- `length`: length of data field
- (optional) `data`: relevant information


### `ping`/`pong`

## Sub-messages

The following serializations can be consistently used below.

### Updates list

Progress off-chain is achieved by one participant proposing a set of updates to
be applied on top of the last state as well as the next state that is
produced.
A single off-chain update's serialization has the following structure:

```
  name                  size (bytes)
 ---------------------- ----
| length               | 2  |
 ---------------------- ----
| data                 | N  |
 ---------------------- ----
```

The length is the size of the data field.

A list of updates is a appended list of 0 or more such updates.


## Establishing channel off-chain

```
A (initiator)          B
|                      |
|---  channel_open  -->|
|<-- channel_accept ---|
|                      |
|-- funding_created -->|
|<- funding_signed  ---|
|                      |
|--- funding_locked -->|
|<-- funding_locked ---|
|                      |
```

In order to establish a channel both parties need to agree on the initial
conditions, e.g. funding amounts, minimum reserve and lock time.

By default the initiator of the channel will pay the fee for the opening
transaction.


### `channel_open`

Message code: 1

This message initiates the opening of a channel and communicates the
initiators' intent to a potential future party.

The `channel_open` message should provide the accepting party all the
information it needs to assess whether or not it should accept the channel.


```
  name                  size (bytes)
 ---------------------- ----
| chain_hash           | 32 |
 ---------------------- ----
| temporary_channel_id | 32 |
 ---------------------- ----
| lock_period          | 2  |
 ---------------------- ----
| push_amount          | 8  |
 ---------------------- ----
| initiator_amount     | 8  |
 ---------------------- ----
| responder_amount     | 8  |
 ---------------------- ----
| channel_reserve      | 8  |
 ---------------------- ----
| initiator_pubkey     | 32 |
 ---------------------- ----
| responder_pubkey     | 32 |
 ---------------------- ----
```

- `chain_hash`: genesis block hash of the chain you want to use
- `temporary_channel_id`: randomly chosen id unique between the involved
  parties
- `lock_period`: time measured in key blocks in which unilateral channel
  events can be disputed
- `push_amount`: initial deposit in favour of the responder by the initiator
- `initiator_amount`: amount the initiator is willing to commit
- `responder_amount`: amount the initiator wants the responder to commit
- `channel_reserve`: the minimum amount both parties need to maintain, amount
  of coins a party is to lose in case of acting maliciously
- `initiator_pubkey`: the account that the initiator wants to use to open the
  channel
- `responder_pubkey`: the account that the initiator expects as a responder on
  the channel


(***TODO***: what's the appropriate size for the amounts. Do we want to
discourage channels from holding big amounts?)

(***TODO***: should the initiator send along fee and nonce as well so that the
responder can assemble the `channel_create` themselves?)

In the future state channels might exist across different chains, at which point
specifying a `chain_hash` will become meaningful.

The `lock_period` can be chosen freely. Setting it too high might lock up funds
for too long in the case of non-cooperation and setting it too low could leave
a party without enough time to react to a malicious party trying to unilaterally
close a channel.

Having the ability to include a `push_amount`, which credits funds to the other
party, simplifies the common case of wanting to open a channel and pay someone
immediately. An exchange might want to send you funds via this mechanism, since
it requires only one on-chain transaction and has the side effect of also
opening a channel.
If `push_amount > 0` then the initiator should send along an authenticated
update, assigning that amount to the responder, before sending the
`funding_created` message.

A `channel_reserve` ensures that parties have something to lose in the case that
they start acting maliciously. Enforcement of this rule must be done by the
clients, which in practice means they should not authenticate any updates that
end up violating this invariant.


#### Requirements

*Initiator*:

- `chain_hash` MUST identify the chain to be used
- `temporary_channel_id` MUST be unique between the involved parties
- `lock_period` SHOULD be sufficient time to safely publish transactions to the
  blockchain to stop a cheater
- `push_amount` MUST be less or equal to `initiator_amount`
- `initiator_pubkey` MUST be a valid ed25519 pubkey

*Responder* MUST abort if:

- `chain_hash` is unrecognised
- `initiator_pubkey` not a valid ed25519 pubkey
- `temporary_channel_id` is not unique between the parties

*Responder* SHOULD abort if:

- `initiator_pubkey` does not have sufficient balance to cover
  `initiator_amount`

*Responder* MAY abort if:

- `lock_period` is too small
- `push_amount` is too small
- `channel_reserve` is too large or small
- `responder_amount` is too large
- `initiator_amount` is too small


### `channel_accept`

Message code: 2

This message is sent by the `responding` party. It is used to convey the
conditions under which they are willing to accept the terms proposed by the
initiating party.

```
  name                  size (bytes)
 ---------------------- ----
| chain_hash           | 32 |
 ---------------------- ----
| temporary_channel_id | 32 |
 ---------------------- ----
| minimum_depth        | 4  |
 ---------------------- ----
| initiator_amount     | 8  |
 ---------------------- ----
| responder_amount     | 8  |
 ---------------------- ----
| channel_reserve      | 8  |
 ---------------------- ----
| initiator_pubkey     | 32 |
 ---------------------- ----
| responder_pubkey     | 32 |
 ---------------------- ----
```

- `chain_hash`: genesis block hash of the chain you want to use
- `temporary_channel_id`: randomly chosen id unique between the involved
  parties,
- `minimum_depth`: number of blocks until an opening transaction should be
  considered final. The `minimum_depth` is set by the responding party, since
  they will typically be the one providing a service. Note that a
  `minimum_depth` of 0 (zero) will result in a microblock confirmation (see
  below).
- `initiator_amount`: amount the initiator is willing to commit
- `responder_amount`: amount the initiator wants the responder to commit
- `channel_reserve`: the minimum amount both parties need to maintain. This
  makes sure that both have to lose something in case they act maliciously
- `initiator_pubkey`: the account that the initiator used to open the channel
- `responder_pubkey`: the account that the responder used to open the channel

#### Requirements

*Responder*:

- `chain_hash` MUST identify the chain to be used
- `temporary_channel_id` MUST be unique between the involved parties
- `lock_period` SHOULD be sufficient time to safely publish transactions to the
  blockchain to stop a cheater
- `responder_pubkey` MUST be a valid ed25519 pubkey

#### Microblock confirmation

As outlined in [this Bitcoin-NG blog
post](http://hackingdistributed.com/2015/11/09/bitcoin-ng-followup/), _an NG
microblock offers strictly stronger guarantees than a 0-confirmation in
Bitcoin_. In Aeternity, when the minimum-depth confirmation is set to zero,
the system will still wait until the transaction is seen inside a microblock.
This will mean that the transaction has been gossiped, picked up from the
mempool and accepted by a miner.

Note that high-value transactions should wait for a number of keyblocks in
order to guard against forks reorganizing the chain, but a microblock
confirmation offers at least a receipt of that the transaction was initially
accepted.

### `channel_reestablish`

Message code: 3

It is possible to resume a channel which has been terminated either due
to client failure or by the participants mutually agreeing to leave.

```
  name                  size (bytes)
 ---------------------- ----
| chain_hash           | 32 |
 ---------------------- ----
| channel_id           | 32 |
 ---------------------- ----
| length               | 2  |
 ---------------------- ----
| data                 | N  |
 ---------------------- ----
```

The payload (`data`) must be the latest mutually authenticated offchain state,
and the clients must verify that they have the corresponding state trees to
match the state (otherwise, it will not be possible to use the channel later
on.)

In the Aeternity node implementation, the state trees are cached inside the
node.  Note that if the node restarts, cached data is not likely to survive
(it is not persisted on each update for performance reasons.) The Aeternity
node channel FSM automatically recovers the state trees and verifies that the
provided state is in fact the last mutually authenticated state.

#### Requirements

*Responder*:

- MUST abort if the `chain_id` doesn't match the current chain.
- MUST abort if the payload does not correspond to the last known mutually
  authenticated state.
- MUST abort if it doesn't have a corresponding state tree (is able to verify
  proof-of-inclusion) for the provided state.

### `channel_reestablish_ack`

Message code: 4

```
  name                  size (bytes)
 ---------------------- ----
| chain_hash           | 32 |
 ---------------------- ----
| channel_id           | 32 |
 ---------------------- ----
| length               | 2  |
 ---------------------- ----
| data                 | N  |
 ---------------------- ----
```

This is a response message to `channel_reestablish`, expected to contain
identical information.

#### Requirements

*Initiator*:

- MUST abort if contents do not match exactly, those of the preceding
  `channel_reestablish`
- MUST abort if the `chain_id` doesn't match the current chain.
- MUST abort if the payload does not correspond to the last known mutually
  authenticated state.
- MUST abort if it doesn't have a corresponding state tree (is able to verify
  proof-of-inclusion) for the provided state.


### `funding_created`

Message code: 5

In order to open a channel on chain, parties need to cooperate and mutually
authenticate the `channel_create` transaction. The `funding_created` message
is used by the initiator to send an initial state - a `channel_create_tx`
object, authenticated by the Initiator. The `block_hash` specifies which
on-chain environment was used to prepare the transaction ensuring both
participants share a common view of the chain.

```
  name                  size (bytes)
 ---------------------- ----
| temporary_channel_id | 32 |
 ---------------------- ----
| block_hash           | 32 |
 ---------------------- ----
| length of create tx  | 2  |
 ---------------------- ----
| channel_create tx    | N  |
 ---------------------- ----
| list of updates      |    |
 ---------------------- ----
```


#### Requirements

*Responder*:

- MUST abort if the size of the serialized channel_create transaction does not
  match `length`
- MUST abort if the `data` cannot be deserialized into a valid
  `channel_create_tx` object
- MUST abort if the provided `block_hash` is not part of the main chain as the
  responder sees it or if one considers it too old
- MUST abort if the authentication method used is invalid for the provided
  transaction data on the current top block
- MUST abort if disagrees with updates provided

### `funding_signed`

Message code: 6

If the responder was able to validate the initiator's authentication method
sent in the `funding_created` message, then it should add its own authentication
to the state object. The mutually authenticated object will become the initial
off-chain state of the channel. Responder provides the `block_hash` to specify
which on-chain environment was used for producing the signature or meta
transaction.

```
  name                  size (bytes)
 ---------------------- ----
| temporary_channel_id | 32 |
 ---------------------- ----
| block_hash           | 32 |
 ---------------------- ----
| length               | 2  |
 ---------------------- ----
| channel_create tx    | N  |
 ---------------------- ----
```

#### Requirements

*Initiator*:

- MUST abort if the size of the channel_create transaction does not match
  `length`
- MUST abort if the `data` cannot be deserialized into a valid
  `channel_create_tx` object
- MUST abort if the `data` object isn't the offered initial state
- MUST abort if the `data` object isn't mutually authenticated by both parties.
- MUST abort if the `block_hash` is too old


### `funding_locked`

Message code: 7

Opening a channel requires an on-chain transaction. This transaction needs to be
included in a block and, since we only have probabilistic finality, be
sufficiently confirmed, so that the probability of a chain re-organisation is
negligible.

This message is exchanged by both parties to signal to each other that the above
condition has been met from their point of view and only after both of them
agree on this, can the channel be considered to be opened.

All subsequent messages must use the included `channel_id` instead of the
`temporary_channel_id`.


```
  name                  size (bytes)
 ---------------------- ----
| temporary_channel_id | 32 |
 ---------------------- ----
| channel_id           | 32 |
 ---------------------- ----
```


#### Requirements

- A node MUST NOT send the `funding_locked` message unless the `channel_create`
transaction has `minimum_depth` confirmations.

## State update

State updates require consent of both parties.

Each update MUST have a strictly increasing round, which SHOULD start
at `0` on channel initialisation.

Parameters:

- `channel_id`:
- `balances`:
- `state`


### `update`

Message code: 8

Once `funding_locked` messages have been exchanged, the channel enters the
`open` state. Changes to the off-chain state can be effected by sending an
`update` message. It consists of a single-authenticated off-chain transaction
and a list of updates list containing the operations to be performed on the
previous state. The `state_hash` of the off-chain transaction is the
aggregated root hash of the resulting state trees after the updates had been
applied. The receiver must verify that the state is the correct outcome, then
return it, mutually authenticated, in an `update_ack` message.

The `block_hash` is the hash of which on-chain environment was used for
computing the state and either this block or any more recent one could be used
to validate the state. Signatures or Generic Account's meta transactions are
checked according to the latest channel object persisted on-chain. If there are
updates that are contact executions using on-chain data: the block of
`block_hash` is being used for building a consistent state on each
participant's side.

```
  name                  size (bytes)
 ---------------------- ----
| channel_id           | 32 |
 ---------------------- ----
| block_hash           | 32 |
 ---------------------- ----
| length               | 2  |
 ---------------------- ----
| channel_offchain tx  | N  |
 ---------------------- ----
| list of updates      |    |
 ---------------------- ----
```

### `update_ack`

Message code: 9

In response to an `update` message, the receiving side validates that the received
updates are indeed desired. Then one verifies that the operations
listed in the updates list, applied to the most recent mutually authenticated
state, results in a state tree corresponding to the `state_hash` in the
transaction. If so, the state object is mutually authenticated, then returned
as payload in an `update_ack` message. The `block_hash` denotes the the
on-chain environment in which the authentication was done. The authentication
method described in the latest channel on-chain persisted object must be used.

```
  name                  size (bytes)
 ---------------------- ----
| channel_id           | 32 |
 ---------------------- ----
| block_hash           | 32 |
 ---------------------- ----
| length               | 2  |
 ---------------------- ----
| channel_offchain tx  | N  |
 ---------------------- ----
```

### `update_error`

Message code: 10

Since both sides may initiate an `update` request, it is possible that both
may do so at roughly the same time. In particular, in the Aeternity node system,
if an `update` request arrives while the FSM is waiting for its client to
authenticate a new state update, it reverts both its own update attempt and the
other participant's update request by sending an `update_error` message.
The `round` element signifies the round of the fallback state, which must
be the last mutually authenticated state. The receiver does not reply.

```
  name                  size (bytes)
 ---------------------- ----
| channel_id           | 32 |
 ---------------------- ----
| round                | 4  |
 ---------------------- ----
```

### `deposit_created`

Message code: 11

In order to deposit more funds into the channel, one party can initiate
a `deposit_created` request. It consists of a single-authenticated
`channel_deposit_tx` transaction as well as a list of updates. The transaction
includes the state hash and round of the next off-chain state, after applying
the updates on top of latest state. 

Note that it is possible to deposit a zero amount, essentially making the
operation an on-chain snapshot.

The receiving side verifies the operation and authenticate the state, returning
it in an `deposit_signed` message.

The `block_hash` defines the block used for deposit creation and
depositor's authentication method will be according to the latest on-chain
persisted account and not the on-chain persisted channel object.

```
  name                  size (bytes)
 ---------------------- ----
| channel_id           | 32 |
 ---------------------- ----
| block_hash           | 32 |
 ---------------------- ----
| length of deposit tx | 2  |
 ---------------------- ----
| channel_deposit tx   | N  |
 ---------------------- ----
| list of updates      |    |
 ---------------------- ----
```


### `deposit_signed`

Message code: 12

This is an acknowledgement of a preceding `deposit_created` message (see
above). Upon receipt of a mutually authenticated state, the receiver verifies
that it is indeed the state resulting from the proposed deposit operation. The
`channel_deposit_tx` is then pushed to the chain, and the requisit number of
confirmations (`minimum_depth`) are awaited. Once confirmation has been
received, a `deposit_locked` message is sent, with the hash of the
`channel_deposit_tx` transaction.
The `block_hash` defines at which block deposit had been mutually
authenticated and the second authentication will be according to the latest
on-chain persisted account and not the on-chain persisted channel object.

```
  name                  size (bytes)
 ---------------------- ----
| channel_id           | 32 |
 ---------------------- ----
| block_hash           | 32 |
 ---------------------- ----
| length of deposit tx | 2  |
 ---------------------- ----
| channel_deposit tx   | N  |
 ---------------------- ----
```

### `deposit_locked`

Message code: 13

This message is sent upon receipt of a `minimum_depth` confirmation for a
`channel_deposit_tx` transaction. The payload is the hash of the
`channel_deposit_tx` transaction object. Once the message has been sent,
the channel returns to the `open` state and the new off-chain state is
useable.

```
  name                  size (bytes)
 ---------------------- ----
| channel_id           | 32 |
 ---------------------- ----
| tx hash              | 32 |
 ---------------------- ----
```

### `deposit_error`

Message code: 14

Since both sides may initiate a `deposit_created` request, it is possible
that both may do so at roughly the same time. In particular, in the Aeternity node
system, if a `deposit_created` request arrives while the FSM is waiting for
its client to authenticate a new state update, it reverts both its own update
attempt and the other participant's update request by sending a `deposit_error`
message. The `round` element signifies the round of the fallback state, which
must be the last mutually authenticated state. The receiver does not reply.

```
  name                  size (bytes)
 ---------------------- ----
| channel_id           | 32 |
 ---------------------- ----
| round                | 4  |
 ---------------------- ----
```


### `withdraw_created`

Message code: 15

In order to withdraw coins from the channel, one party can initiate
a `withdraw_created` request. It consists of a single-authenticated
`channel_withdraw_tx` and a list of updates. The transaction includes the state
hash and round of the next off-chain state, after applying the updates.
Note that it is possible to withdraw a zero amount, essentially making the
operation an on-chain snapshot.

The receiving side verifies the operation and mutually authenticated the state,
returning it in an `withdraw_signed` message.

The `block_hash` defines on which block the withdrawal had been created and
the withdrawer authentication method will be according to the latest on-chain
persisted account and not the on-chain persisted channel object.

```
  name                  size (bytes)
 ---------------------- ----
| channel_id           | 32 |
 ---------------------- ----
| block_hash           | 32 |

### `withdraw_signed`

Message code: 16

This is an acknowledgement of a preceding `withdraw_created` message (see
above). Upon receipt of a mutually authenticated state, the receiver verifies
that it is indeed the state resulting from the proposed withdrawal operation.
The `channel_withdraw_tx` is then pushed to the chain, and the requisit number
of confirmations (`minimum_depth`) are awaited. Once confirmation has been
received, a `withdraw_locked` message is sent, with the hash of the
`channel_withdraw_tx` transaction.
The `block_hash` defines on which block the withdrawal had been mutually
authenticated and the second authentication method will be according to the
latest on-chain persisted account and not the on-chain persisted channel object.


```

```

### `withdraw_locked`

Message code: 17

This message is sent upon receipt of a `minimum_depth` confirmation for a
`channel_withdraw_tx` transaction. The payload is the hash of the
`channel_withdraw_tx` transaction object. Once the message has been sent,
the channel returns to the `open` state and the new off-chain state is
useable.

```

### `withdraw_error`

Message code: 18

Since both sides may initiate a `withdraw_created` request, it is possible
that both may do so at roughly the same time. In particular, in the Aeternity node
system, if a `withdraw_created` request arrives while the FSM is waiting for
its client to authentication a new state update, it reverts both its own update
attempt and the other participant's withdraw request by sending a
`withdraw_error` message. The `round` element signifies the round of the
fallback state, which must be the last mutually authenticated state. The
receiver does not reply.

```
  name                  size (bytes)
 ---------------------- ----

 ---------------------- ----

 ---------------------- ----
```

## Other interaction

### `inband_message`

Message code: 96

Inband messages are arbitrary messages sent between the channel participants.
The payload must be limited to 65,535 bytes. The FSM must deliver an inband
message immediately, and the receiver must process it (e.g. conveying it to
the client) immediately, preserving the message ordering.

One possible use of inband messages could be to synchronize off-chain state
updates, but any application is allowed.

## Channel closing


### `leave`

Message code: 94

While it is possible to simply drop out of a channel and later reestablish it,
the success of the reestablishing operation depends on the other party keeping
the most recent copy of the state. The polite way to ensure this is to send
a `leave` request. The receiving side is expected to respond with a `leave_ack`.

```
  name                  size (bytes)
 ---------------------- ----
| channel_id           | 32 |
 ---------------------- ----
```


### `leave_ack`

Message code: 95

This message is sent in response to a `leave` request. The sender may terminate
its side once the message has been delivered. The receiver should wait for
the `leave_ack` before it terminates.

```
  name                  size (bytes)
 ---------------------- ----
| channel_id           | 32 |
 ---------------------- ----
```

### `shutdown`

Message code: 98

In order to close the channel in an orderly fashion, a `shutdown` message
is sent, passing a singly authenticated `channel_close_mutual_tx` transaction
object as payload. The sender creates the `channel_close_mutual_tx` from the
latest mutually authenticated state, including the root hash of the
corresponding state tree. The receiver must verify that the payload corresponds
to its latest mutually authenticated state, and then replies with a
`shutdown_ack` message. The `block_hash` defines on which block the close
mutual had been created and the closer's authentication method will be according
to the latest on-chain persisted account and not the on-chain persisted channel
object.

```
  name                  size (bytes)
 ---------------------- ----
| channel_id           | 32 |
 ---------------------- ----

 ---------------------- ----
| length               | 2  |
 ---------------------- ----
| close mutual tx      | N  |
 ---------------------- ----
```

### `shutdown_ack`

Message code: 99

This message is sent in response to a verified `shutdown` message. The sender
may close once the message has been delivered. The receiver must, after
verifying the payload of the `shutdown_ack` message (which must be the same
`channel_close_mutual_tx` object, mutually authenticated), push the
`channel_close_mutual_tx` transaction onto the chain, and then terminate.
The `block_hash` defines on which block the close mutual had been mutually
authenticated and the second authentication method will be according to the
latest on-chain persisted account and not the on-chain persisted channel object.

```
  name                  size (bytes)

## Channel closing

A channel can be closed under three circumstances:

1. Both parties agree to the close and authenticate the closing transaction
   together, which then gets broadcasted and included in the blockchain.
2. One party wants to close the channel: the other party might had been missing
   for some time or had been trying to cheat. In this case either side can publish 
   the latest state authenticated by both parties and claim their balance after
   the negotiated timeout.
3. A malicious party tries to publish an outdated state, which it prefers over a
   later state. In this case the honest party can publish a state
   authenticated by both with a higher round and thereby prove that the other
   one is trying to cheat. A transaction with a higher round overwrites the one
   with a lower one.

In the case that both parties decide to close the channel, funds are accessible
immediately after the transaction of their agreement is included in a block,
otherwise they have to wait at least `lock_period` blocks for disputes.

```
A                       B
|                       |
|----   shutdown    --->|
|<---   shutdown    ----|
|          .            |
|          .            |
|  resolve pending op   |
|          .            |
|          .            |
|          .            |
|<-- closing_created ---|
|--- closing_signed  -->|
|                       |
```

In case of both parties want to close the channel in agreement and
there are enough coins left in the channel to pay for the fee, then the
the advised distribution of returning the coins left in the channel is
as follows:

```
if initiator_amount + responder_amount < fee
  return error
else if initiator_amount >= ceil(fee/2) && responder_amount >= floor(fee/2)
  initiator_final := initiator_amount - ceil(fee/2)
  responder_final := responder_amount - floor(fee/2)
else if responder_amount >= ceil(fee/2) && initiator_amount >= floor(fee/2)
  responder_final := responder_amount - ceil(fee/2)
  initiator_final := initiator_amount - floor(fee/2)
else if initiator_amount > responder_amount
  initiator_final := initiator_amount - fee + responder_amount
  responder_final := 0
else
  responder_final := responder_amount - fee + initiator_amount
  initiator_final := 0
  ```

This is an example distribution of the fee. If this is to be accepted as a
norm - it means that one of the parties will propose these final amounts in the
closing transaction and the other, also following this advise, will
happily authenticate it.
What ends up on-chain is the fee and the closing amounts of
the parties. The process by which they got to agreement is not part of the
protocol itself.


### `shutdown`

```
  name                  size (bytes)
 ---------------------- ----
| channel_id           | 32 |
 ---------------------- ----
```


The `shutdown` message initiates the closing of a channel and can be sent by
either party. After a party sends the `shutdown` message, it MUST NOT propose any
more update messages.


#### Requirements

A shutdown cannot be initiated before the on-chain channel opening is
authenticated.

The initiator MUST NOT send a `shutdown` before a `funding_created` and the
responder MUST NOT send a `shutdown` before a `funding_signed` has been sent.
Prior to the respective points parties can still safely abort the procedure
without having committed to anything.

### `closing_created`

If the parties agree to a shutdown then they both need to authenticate the
`channel_close_mutual` transaction

### `closing_signed`


## Local state

Parties need to store local state in order to be able to keep track of state
channel operations.

- `chain_hash`
- `initiator_pubkey`
- `responder_pubkey`
- `initiator_amount`
- `responder_amount`
- `channel_active`
- `round`
- `updated_at`
- `closed`
- [{}]

## Contracts

Execution of a contract inside a state channel requires parties to be able to
initialise a virtual machine to run their smart contracts in.

Contracts are executed in rounds, which are denoted by `round` attribute.

Every party executes each smart contract locally and checks if the
authenticated state they receive match up with theirs. In the case that state
and authentication are valid, they apply the update and then send out their
own authentication. If there was an error in either the execution of the
contract or the authentication failed, they send a new update with the prior
state but an increased round numberâ€”to avoid confusionâ€“and their authentication
method over it, to signal that something went wrong.

When operating in mutually authenticated mode, contracts might need to be
written in a way to avoid the free option problem.

### On-chain enforcement

- submit code, state, inputs
- code should output new distribution of balances?
- submit a hash of what is expected to be the root of the new state
- parties could choose to continue from there

With on chain enforcement of contracts it becomes possible to unilaterally force
progress by publishing contract, state and input on chain. A miner would then
execute the contract given the state and inputs to produce a new state. This new
state could then either be used for both parties to continue operation from there
or leave it at that.

### Contracts lifecycle

Contracts are part of the [update](#state-update) mechanism: it is different
updates that are being used. Serialization of those can be found [here](../serializations.md#channel-off-chain-update).

First one participant initiates an update round containing a [channel create
contract update](../serializations.md#channel-off-chain-update-create-contract). It contains all the
information needed for a contract creation. The other participant
authenticates the changes and the contract is considered to be created.

After a contract is created it can be called. For this one of the participants
initiates an update round containing a [channel call
contract update](../serializations.md#channel-off-chain-update-call-contract).
It contains all the information needed for a contract call, including the
contract address. The other participant authenticates the changes and the contract
call is considered to be executed. Its results can be extracted from the calls
tree in the state tree.
Part of the call is the `amount` a participants commits to the contract. This
is not to be confused with [gas consumption](#gas-consumption) - `amount` are
the tokens moved from the caller's off-chain balance to the off-chain balance
of the contract been called.

### Contracts referring to on-chain data

Contracts being used in channels off-chain calls have the exact same semantics
as [those being used
on-chain](/contracts/contract_transactions.md#contract-call-transaction). Because of the different environment however,
off-chain calls  might have different results as the on-chain ones.

Since there is no single source of truth, each participant considers their
current view of the chain to be the correct one. This is essential for the
trustless environment. Every off-chain contract call is based on the top of
the chain, as it is seen by each participant. This could cause some differences
in local contract executions. If those can not be resolved, participants can
always rely on the blockchain as an arbiter by using forcing of progress. Then
the top is used as it is seen by the Bitcoin-NG leader.

It is worth mentioning that both local contracts' executions and the forced
progress ones must be fully deterministic and this implies some restrictions
on using on-chain objects in the off-chain contracts.
This is especially true for the chain-related primitives (e.g. coinbase,
timestamp, block height, difficulty). Please refer to the documentation of the
applicable VM version. Registration and updates of names or asking of oracles
is impossible in the off-chain contract calls.

Using on-chain contracts in off-chain ones is a tricky task. On-chain
contracts reference-count contracts that refer to them. They can be deleted
from the blockchain only once they are no longer referenced by any other
contract.
This can not be enforced for off-chain contracts because there is no knowledge
of them on-chain. Also if we were to use an on-chain contract referencing it
by a registered name, the name on-chain could be changed to point to another
different contract. This opens a security hole especially if one of the
participants is in control of the name.
For these reasons off-chain contracts are not allowed to use on-chain ones,
not even stateless on-chain contracts. Participants can still use well-known
contracts that are present on-chain but they have to copy them into their
off-chain state. That way participants take care of their own data in a
trustless manner - they don't have to rely on other entities keeping contracts
on-chain for them.

### Gas consumption

While making off-chain updates that both parties authenticate, no gas is being
consumed. It is worth mentioning that although contract call updates do include
values for the gas limit and the gas price, those are ignored. Assumption is
that since both participants are executing the contracts locally, they are
equal in their energy consumption.

When a dispute arises and a contract is to be called on-chain, the miner that
includes the transaction should be compensated for the energy used. That's why
when forcing progress of off-chain contract calls gas is consumed. Gas limit
and gas prices are specified in the contract call update itself. Now the
values not being used off-chain come into play. Since the force progress is an
unilateral act, it is the forcer that specifies them and it is the forcer's
on-chain balance that is paying for the consumed gas.
